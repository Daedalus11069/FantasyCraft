It’s no surprise then that they’re also the most detailed. Fantasy Craft offers all the tools you need to create thousands of unique protagonists whose stories are yours to tell. That story might be an epic of moral challenges and great deeds, a bawdy tale of comedy to pass the time, or a simple war story. No approach is superior — it’s purely a matter of taste.</p><p>This chapter presents all the steps you take to create your character mechanically — that is, according to the rules. It shows you the roles you can take and how the experience you gain from adventuring advances your statistics, or “stats” (the terms and numbers used to determine what you can do and whether you succeed when you try something risky). The Game Master uses your stats to develop challenges for your party and it’s in these numbers that the game is fun and challenging on a tactical level.</p><p>As discussed earlier (see page 4), the social end of the game runs differently for every group. Most of the options in this chapter — especially Interests — lend to the social game, offering seeds for roleplaying and ways to expand the story and setting. These are just the beginning of each character’s personal journey and you should always watch for new ways to define your character and make him something truly special. The GM can help and many tools are provided in Chapter 7 to do so.</p><h1>CREATING A CHARACTER</h1><p>Creating a Fantasy Craft character is a simple process that begins with a blank character sheet. You can download one from www.crafty-games.com or photocopy pages 396–399 of this book. Then just follow these steps. Experienced players may find it easier to skip around in the process but first-timers should follow the steps in order until they’re comfortable with them. Detailed instructions are provided for each step beginning on the pages listed in parentheses.</p><p><strong>Step 0: Concept (below):</strong> At the core of every hero is a powerful concept. You might become a dashing rogue, a grizzled military veteran, a wandering knight, a cunning spy, or an adventurer of your own creation.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Attributes (page 8):</strong> Your basic abilities are set by scores in each of six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Origin (page 9):</strong> Some of your most distinctive traits have been forged ‘before the story begins.’ Your Origin takes care of this, painting your past in broad strokes with a Species choice and a Specialty that suggests your early history.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Career Level (page 27):</strong> Your overall power is determined by your Career Level, which provides several benefits to all heroes, regardless of their other character options.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Class (page 28):</strong> Your class shapes your role in the party, offering a themed benefit package that grows as you  adventure. Each class offers a unique collection of bonuses, skills, and abilities that customize your strengths and weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Skills (page 63):</strong> Your class also grants you skill points that you spend to become better at various tasks.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Feats (page 84):</strong> Feats let you augment your abilities with unusual actions and spectacular stunts.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Interests (page 61):</strong> Craving more depth than your average dungeoneer? Interests include moral and ethical stances, languages, and personal indulgences you pursue between heroic deeds. Beyond rounding out your character, they offer an edge in situations related to your passion.</p><p><strong>Step 8: Character Sheet (page 61):</strong> Here you fill in all the boxes on your sheet that are still empty. A few minutes of simple calculation and you’re nearly done!</p><p><strong>Step 9: Starting Gear (page 152):</strong> Finally, distribute your Lifestyle points to determine how well your character lives and saves, then hit the outfitters to gear up for your first adventure!</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"STEP 0: CONCEPT","type":"text","_id":"vknVwd6OUHJoGI68","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p></p><p>Developing a strong concept greatly increases the chance of an enjoyable play experience, so it’s a good idea to make a few key decisions before choosing character options. Generally, the longer you expect to play a character the more time you should invest in crafting the concept, though even a little effort can go a long way.</p><p>Always speak with your GM before settling on a concept — he might have some preferences or want to apply some restrictions. Chatting with the other players is often a good idea also, as you can compliment each other’s strengths and work the party’s history into your own. Every successful concept has three essentials: description, methods, and motivation.</p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p>The words and numbers on your character sheet speak to what you can do, but they say nothing for who you are. What’s your gender? What’s your name? Where do you come from? Your GM can probably provide a list of common names and cultures to choose from and in a well-defined setting your birthplace might also speak to your appearance and other facets of your concept. In a ‘generic’ or loose fantasy world just go with a name that sounds cool — maybe one derived from a favorite fantasy novel or movie — and add a few interesting background details that seem easy to fit into lots of adventures.</p><p>Next question: What do you look like? A good physical description pays off immediately, rooting you in the action and helping the GM and other players visualize you in the world.</p><p>Finally, consider your personality and the things that shaped it. What’s your outlook? What are a few of the things you crave and shun? What’s your family like and where are they now? Do you have siblings or children? This is often the most complex part of your character’s description; fortunately, you can save any of it you’re not ready to answer until later, developing and learning about it as the game unfolds.</p><h2>METHODS</h2><p>Knowing how you approach problems is especially helpful as it informs your decisions throughout play. As with personality, it’s not important to have it all worked out before you dive into your first adventure, though. You might start out with a general theme in mind, such as relying upon brute force, keen wisdom, broad knowledge, fierce skill, or a gift of the tongue. Alternately you could skim the classes and feats to see if something catches your eye. In either case aim for methods that excite you and mesh well with the rest of your concept and the other characters in your party.</p><h2>MOTIVATION</h2><p>Heroes tend to launch themselves headlong into deadly situations, hopefully emerging victorious and stronger for the experience. When thinking about why you’re more than ordinary, it’s crucial to choose goals and motivations powerful enough to justify setting aside the comforts of home for life-threatening adventure. Your motivations also offer the GM hooks so he can sweep you into the action without twisting your arm. Most important of all, a well-crafted motivation gives you a solid reason to work with the other player characters.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"STEP 1: ATTRIBUTES","type":"text","_id":"w0ZUgQPZxBPnOyBl","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Your most basic strengths and weaknesses are defined by six “attributes” — three physical (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) and three mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma).</p><p><strong>Strength (Str):</strong> Physical power and musculature</p><p><strong>Dexterity (Dex):</strong> Physical grace</p><p><strong>Constitution (Con):</strong> Health and toughness</p><p><strong>Intelligence (Int):</strong> Ability to learn and reason</p><p><strong>Wisdom (Wis):</strong> Common sense, intuition, and perception</p><p><strong>Charisma (Cha):</strong> Attractiveness, personality, persuasiveness, and guile</p><p>Each attribute begins with a score of 8 to 18 and generates a modifier. Scores of 10 and 11 are average for most characters and grant a modifier of +0. For every 2 points above or below this range, the modifier increases or decreases by 1, as shown on Table 1.1: Attribute Scores (see right). These modifiers are applied to many things, as shown in the Skills section of Chapter 2 and Table 1.2: Attribute Modifiers (see below).</p><h1>STARTING ATTRIBUTE SCORES</h1><p>You have 36 points to spend on attributes. Costs are shown on Table 1.1. Assign the highest scores to represent your strengths and the lowest scores to represent your weaknesses. Keep in mind that many classes benefit from certain attributes and that your Origin often adjusts your starting attributes as well (see Table 1.3: Origins, page 10).</p><p><em>Example:</em> Kevin uses his 36 points to purchase a Strength of 13 (6 points), a Dexterity of 15 (11 points), a Constitution of 11 (3 points), an Intelligence of 12 (4 points), a Wisdom of 12 (4 points), and a Charisma of 14 (8 points).</p><h4>Table 1.1: Attribute Scores</h4><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th>Score</th><th>Cost</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><td>1</td><td>-*</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>2-3</td><td>-*</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>-*</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>-*</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>6</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>8</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>14</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>22</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>-*</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>20-21</td><td>-*</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>22-23</td><td>-*</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>24-25</td><td>-*</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>Etc.</td><td>-*</td><td>Etc.</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=\"text-align:center\">* This score may not be purchased at character creation.</p><h4>Table 1.2: Attribute Modifers</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Applications (Excluding Skill Checks)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strength</td><td>Attacks (Melee, Unarmed), Damage (Melee, Unarmed, Hurled)</td></tr><tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>Attacks (Hurled, Ranged), Initiative, Defense, Reflex saves</td></tr><tr><td>Constitution</td><td>Vitality, Wounds, Fortitude saves</td></tr><tr><td>Intelligence</td><td>Knowledge checks, Skill points</td></tr><tr><td>Wisdom</td><td>Will saves, Known Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Charisma</td><td>Lifestyle, Spell Save DC</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>IMPAIRMENT</h1><p>Your attribute scores may change over time, sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently. When a change is permanent, all of your affected scores change accordingly. The same is true of temporary changes, except for vitality, wounds, skill points, known spells, and Lifestyle, which are only affected by permanent attribute changes.</p><p>When an attribute is temporarily impaired, it heals at 1 point per day, so long as you get at least 8 hours’ sleep in that time.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Kevin temporarily loses 4 points of Dexterity, dropping his score from 15 to 11 and his modifier from +2 to +0. This reduces his ranged attack bonus, Initiative bonus, Defense, Reflex save bonus, and Dexterity-based skill check bonuses by 2 each. After 24 hours of further adventure, he recovers 1 point and his modifier rises to +1. Another 24 hours after that, assuming he’s been getting enough shut-eye, he heals another point, but his modifier won’t rise again until the end of Day 3. Unless Kevin suffers further Dexterity impairment, he fully recovers the attribute after Day 4.</p><p>An attribute may not drop below 0. When one or more of your attributes drop to 0, you fall unconscious until each of your attributes is at least 1. In the meantime, you must make a Fortitude save once per day and each time you suffer additional attribute impairment, against a DC of 10 + 1 per previous save. With failure, your wounds immediately drop to –10, resulting in death.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"STEP 2: ORIGIN","type":"text","_id":"uQ7Z7UpagTuBpmf8","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>All heroes start somewhere. Some are humble commoners before the seeds of adventure take root while others are destined for greatness from their first breath. One of the ways you paint these details into your background is with your Origin, which combines a Species describing your race with a Specialty that suggests your history or profession before joining the ranks of the valiant and virtuous.</p><p>Choose 1 Species and 1 Specialty; together they offer a package of benefits supporting a simple name (e.g. “Pech Fencer” or “Orc Tribesman”). If your Species choice is Human, choose a Talent as well. A summary of Origin benefits is found on Table 1.3: Origins (see page 10).</p><h1>ORIGIN SKILLS</h1><p>Once you choose your Origin, skip forward to Chapter 2 and choose two skills you feel someone with your background should inherently grasp. These become your “Origin skills,” meaning that you can always spend skill points to buy ranks in them, even when they’re not currently class skills for you (see page 63).</p><p>Some character choices grant Origin skills, which are gained in addition to these two.</p><h2>SPECIES</h2><p>Fantasy Craft features 12 playable species, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Splinter races, like “hill dwarves” and “dark elves,” are available through Species feats (see page 99). Every species is defined by its Type.</p><h2>TYPE</h2><p>Your Type sets your Size, means of locomotion, wounds, and various character options and rules that apply to all members of your species. Most fantasy species are ‘folk,’ a Type that conveys no special rules; other Types are defined in Chapter 6: Foes (see page 226).</p><p></p><p>Table 1.3: Origins</p><table><thead><tr><th

You begin play with one class but can access others as you gain levels. Your classes are the backbone of your career, showcasing the path you’ve chosen and what you have to offer your party.</p><p>There are three types of classes, each progressively more specialized. Base Classes are available at Career Level 1 and have the broadest focus, Expert Classes become available at Career Level 5 and offer a little more expertise in a narrower field, and Master Classes — available at Level 10 — are the pinnacle of concentrated expertise.</p><p>Fantasy Craft features 12 Base Classes designed to portray larger-than-life adventure heroes in a wide range of settings and stories (see pages 30–52).</p><h1>EXPERT CLASSES</h1><p>Some heroes never deviate from their Base Class, pursuing it to the highest levels of play. Others may diversify or hone themselves for a particular concept or goal. This is where Expert Classes come into play, tailoring your skills and abilities in concentrated ways. Some Expert Classes obviously complement certain Base Classes (e.g. the Beastmaster blends well with the Lancer), but you’re free to mix and match class choices so long as you meet all entry requirements.</p><p>Fantasy Craft features 6 expert classes common in high adventure campaigns (see pages 52–61).</p><h1>MASTER CLASSES</h1><p>At the apex of the class progression, Master Classes offer highly specialized training and deep secrets. They’re usually linked to specific settings and only available when characters prove themselves to NPCs and groups who can provide the training. Unlike Base and Expert Classes, a character may only take levels in a single Master Class.</p><p>Master Classes will be featured in upcoming Fantasy Craft products.</p><h1>MULTI-CLASSING</h1><p>Taking levels in new classes broadens your range of abilities at the expense of progress in previous classes. This is often helpful to round out a concept or give you more options in play. For example, you might start your career as a Keeper but eventually take levels in Soldier to reveal your growing warrior spirit (and make sure you have more to do in a fight).</p><p>When you have levels in multiple classes, you gain their sum vitality, skill points, and table bonuses, as well as all abilities granted by your level in each class.</p><h1>CLASS DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p>Classes are laid out in five main sections, allowing you to quickly identify their style, strengths, and benefits.</p><h2>SUMMARY</h2><p>Each class begins with a general summary of its theme and capabilities. Several examples demonstrate how you can use this class in a variety of ways. These are intentionally broad — feel free to ignore the obvious stereotypes and pursue your own destiny.</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> This suggests ways you can contribute to the success of your party. Classes can and often do fill more than one role. The five main party roles in Fantasy Craft are <strong>Backer</strong> (improves the entire party’s performance), <strong>Combatant</strong> (good at fighting), <strong>Specialist</strong> (master of one or more skills), <strong>Solver</strong> (excels at plot advancement and information gathering), and <strong>Talker</strong> (great with NPCs and social situations). A few classes are described as <strong>Wildcards</strong> — they have enough going on that they can fill in for two or more of the other roles depending on how their abilities develop.</p><h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2><p>Requirements: Some classes have requirements that you must meet before you can gaining levels in them.</p><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> These are the most commonly helpful attributes for this class, in order from most to somewhat desirable. These don’t have to be your highest attributes (they can even be your lowest!), but beginners may want to focus on them until they become familiar with the game.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Some classes grant “Casting Levels,” which influence spells you cast. </p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> You may only spend your skill points to buy ranks in these skills.</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> These are used to buy skill ranks (see page 63). You get 4 times the usual number at Career Level 1 only. Vitality: This is a measure of your character’s ability to avoid injury (see page 206).</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> These represent weapon training. You may spend 1 proficiency to become “trained” with each weapon category: Bow, Blunt, Edged, Hurled, Siege, and Unarmed. Some settings also feature Black Powder weapons. Spending an additional proficiency on a category grants you a “forte” with it, which translates to a +1 bonus with attacks made using those weapons. Certain weapons are tricky to use and require a forte to wield (see footnotes on tables throughout the weapons section, starting on page 176). You may also spend proficiencies to learn tricks (see page 221).</p><p>You start with the proficiencies listed in your first base class and do not gain the proficiencies listed in any other class. After Career Level 1, proficiencies are only gained as shown on Table 1.4: Career Level (see page 27). Whenever you gain a proficiency you already have, you may choose a different one.</p><h2>CORE ABILITY</h2><p>Each class bestows a single “core ability” that serves as its cornerstone. It can be something the class does often, well, or to support later abilities. You only ever gain the core ability of the first Base Class you enter — the core abilities of all other Base Classes are unavailable to you. Likewise, you may only ever gain the core ability of the first Expert Class you enter. Master Classes do not offer core abilities.</p><h2>CLASS ABILITIES</h2><p>At the heart of every class are abilities gained as your Class Level rises. These are special things you can do, bonuses applied to various skills and actions, and other benefits of training. Several special rules relate to class abilities.</p><p><strong>Allies and Teammates:</strong> Abilities that affect “allies” can target any standard or special character on your side, while abilities that affect “teammates” may only target special characters on your side.</p><p><strong>Bonus Action Dice:</strong> Some abilities grant “bonus action dice.” When an ability doesn’t specify die type these dice are the same type you gain at the start of each session (see Table 1.4: Career Level, page 27).</p><p><strong>Doubled Action Dice:</strong> Some abilities allow you to roll 2 dice when you spend 1 action die. When two or more of these abilities apply to the same roll, you still only roll 2 dice for each action die spent.</p><p><strong>Legacy Abilities:</strong> Some abilities are shared by more than one class and grow in stages as the character gains experience. A Roman numeral follows each legacy ability’s name (e.g. “uncanny dodge I,” “gifts &amp; favors III,” and so on). When you gain a legacy ability from two or more classes, the Roman numeral numbers are added together to determine the ability’s overall effectiveness (to a maximum of the highest numbered ability offered by any of your classes).</p><p><strong>Location-Specific Abilities:</strong> Some abilities may only be used when you’re in a specific area, as noted in parentheses following the ability’s name (e.g. “gifts and favors (city)”). In the case of a city, you must be located in an area with a population of 1,000 or more to use the ability.</p><p><strong>Restricted and Temporary Feats:</strong> These are explained in the Feats section (see page 84).</p><p><strong>Starting Action Dice:</strong> Many abilities have a number of uses or grant a bonus based on your starting action dice (see Table 1.4: Career Level, page 27). Character options that increase or decrease starting action dice affect these abilities normally.</p><p><strong>Time-Reducing Abilities:</strong> No more than one character option or game effect may reduce an activity’s required time.</p><h2>CLASS TABLE</h2><p>Your class table sets or improves several of your statistics.</p><p><strong>BAB:</strong> Your base attack bonus, to which your Strength modifier is added (for unarmed and melee attacks), or your Dexterity modifier is added (for ranged attacks).</p><p><strong>Fort:</strong> Your base Fortitude save bonus, to which your Constitution modifier is added.</p><p><strong>Ref:</strong> Your base Reflex save bonus, to which your Dexterity modifier is added.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Your base Will save bonus, to which your Wisdom modifier is added.</p><p><strong>Def Bon:</strong> Your base Defense bonus, which is added with your Dexterity modifier to a base score of 10 (e.g. with a base Defense bonus of +2 and a Dexterity modifier of +1, your Defense is 13). Unless your Size is Medium, it applies a modifier as well (see page 217).</p><p><strong>Init:</strong> Your base Initiative bonus, to which your Dexterity modifier is added.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Your base Lifestyle, to which your Charisma modifier is added (see page 153).</p><p><strong>Legend:</strong> The additional Reputation you earn after each adventure (see page 342).</p><p><strong>SP:</strong> You may use these points to cast spells (see page 110).</p><p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Your class abilities.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":900000,"name":"ASSASSIN","type":"text","_id":"R9sfRZUf2s3Xo9kJ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The Assassin is an agent of violent change, a hidden warrior removing key figures for flag or fortune. He’s a natural social chameleon, skilled at avoiding notice and gaining entry to so-called secure areas. He does this not by slipping from shadow to shadow but by moving with the flow of people, exploiting the anonymity of crowds. Once in place, he strikes with absolute precision; he can’t afford to harm bystanders or leave behind evidence, as it’s sloppy and won’t earn him any new contracts.</p><p>Depending on your campaign, an Assassin could be...</p><p>• A black-hearted killer only interested in his employer’s coin</p><p>• A ruthless spy serving a lord through ‘diplomacy of the knife’</p><p>• A gentleman-bandit harassing a corrupt monarchy from the shadows</p><p>• A holy warrior silently slaying the enemies of his faith — in their own homes</p><p>• A servant of Magisters, eliminating wild mages before they can grow to full power</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Talker/Combatant. You’re a master at deception and subterfuge, fooling and confusing enemies long enough to deliver a fatal blow. You also recognize the importance of a clean escape and cultivate the fighting skills needed to cut your way to an exit when events undermine your subtle plans.</p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Charisma, Strength, Wisdom</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Blend, Bluff, Crafting, Disguise, Intimidate, Notice, Prestidigitation, Resolve, Sense Motive, Tactics</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 6 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 9 + Con modifier per level</p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 4</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Heartseeker:</strong> Your base attack bonus is considered equal to your Career Level when you attack a special character. Also, your attacks against special characters gain the armor-piercing 2 weapon quality (see page 176).</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>Hand of Death:</strong> At Level 1, each time you fail a Blend or Resolve check and don’t suffer an error, you still succeed as long as the check DC (or your opponent’s check result) is equal to or less than your Class Level + 20. If several grades of success are possible, you achieve only the lowest possible positive result.</p><p>If you gain this ability for either skill from two or more classes, add together your levels in all classes granting the ability when determining its effect.</p><p><strong>Cold Read:</strong> You easily pick up people’s social cues and details about their private lives. At Level 2, once per session as a free action, you may ask the GM a number of personal questions equal to your starting action dice about a character you can see and hear. Sample questions include “What does he do for a living?” and “What is her favorite author?” The target may conceal an answer by spending 1 action die per question ignored. You may target each character with this ability only once per session.</p><p>At Levels 11 and 19, you may use this ability 1 additional time per session.</p><p><strong>Quick on Your Feet:</strong> You often have to think fast in your line of work. At Level 3, you make trained Disguise checks even when you lack a kit. Also, once per session, you may make a Mask or Ambush check as a free action.</p><p>At Levels 7, 11, 15, and 19, you may use this ability 1 additional time per session.</p><p><strong>Unspoken Name:</strong> People speak of your growing legend, though more often with fear than admiration. At Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, you gain 1 rank of Heroic renown and a +1 bonus with Intimidate checks targeting any character who knows about at least one of your previous kills.</p><p><strong>Blade Practice:</strong> You’re familiar with many violent tools. At Level 5, once per adventure, you may spend 1 hour practicing to gain 1 temporary Melee Combat feat of your choice until the end of the current adventure.</p><p>At Levels 9, 13, and 17, you may use this ability 1 additional time per adventure.</p><p><strong>Masks:</strong> You hide your motives and even your identity under many layers of misdirection. At Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, you may choose 1 of the following abilities. Each of these abilities may be chosen only once.</p><p>• <em>Always Ready:</em> You may always act during surprise rounds.</p><p>• <em>Black Vial:</em> You gain a +5 bonus with saves against poison. Also, the DC to save against poison you use increases by 5.</p><p>• <em>Convincing:</em> Once per session, you may force an opponent to re-roll a successful skill check that would penetrate your disguise. You may not force an opponent to re-roll a critical success.</p><p>• <em>Expertise:</em> Choose one: Blend, Bluff, Crafting, Disguise, Intimidate, Notice, Prestidigitation, Resolve, Sense Motive, or Tactics. Taking 10 with this skill doesn’t take twice as long and taking 20 takes only 10 times as long.</p><p>• <em>Fake It:</em> You may credibly pretend to possess a skill you don’t actually have, gaining a +20 bonus with Bluff checks made to feign its use until the end of the scene. This does not actually allow you to use the skill — it merely allows you to act like you can. Thus, you could stand next to a physician working on the injured and pretend to know what’s going on but you couldn’t perform a surgery yourself. You may use this ability a number of times per session equal to your starting action dice.</p><p>• <em>Follow My Lead:</em> Through a mixture of fast-talk and convincing performance you can shield others from scrutiny. Whenever you’re present with a hero who’s in disguise, they gain a Disguise check bonus equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum +1).</p><p>• <em>Offer They Can’t Refuse:</em> When Coercing, your incentive modifiers are always at least extreme (see Table 2.12: Persuasion and Coercion, page 75).</p><p>• <em>Sneak Attack:</em> You gain an additional die of sneak attack damage.</p><p><strong>Bald-Faced Lie:</strong> At Level 10, once per session when you lie to any character, they believe it as truth for a number of minutes equal to your Class Level. Thereafter the target may begin to question the lie, depending on the circumstances. This ability may not support any statement the target absolutely knows to be a lie (e.g. “the sky is green” when it’s a clear day and you’re both outdoors). If you use this ability on a special character, they may make a Will save (DC 10 + your Class Level) to see through the deception.</p><p>At Level 20, you may use this ability up to twice per session.</p><p><strong>Finish Him!:</strong> You’ve elevated the murder of influential and dangerous foes to an art form. At Level 14, your threat range with attacks and skill checks targeting special characters increases by 4. Also, when one of your attacks or actions would kill a special character, they cannot Cheat Death (see page 384).</p><h4> Table 1.5: The Assassin</h4><table

a world of killing things and taking their stuff, thievery is a time-honored profession. The Burglar cuts out the middle man, using guile, stealth, and good old fashioned dirty tricks to pull off daring raids and heists — often without drawing his weapon. He brings a powerful blend of abilities to an adventuring party, helping them overcome dangerous traps and barriers, circumvent guards, and cut through the defenses of particularly dangerous enemies.</p><p>Depending on your campaign, a Burglar could be...</p><p>• A danger junkie stealing the most highly guarded prizes for the thrill alone</p><p>• A pit fighting champion relying on speed and wits to stay on top</p><p>• A ninja penetrating fortresses and manor houses to steal secrets and lives</p><p>• A criminal mastermind leading a band of cutthroats to glory and riches</p><p>• A traveling merchant fending off bandits and other peril on the road</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Specialist/Combatant. You are the pre-eminent master of stealth, casually slipping past all but the most impressive security and outwitting all but the savviest guards. You specialize in snatch and grab more than fisticuffs but you’re not afraid of a scrap when the need arises.</p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Crafting, Haggle, Investigate, Notice, Prestidigitation, Ride, Search, Sneak, Tactics</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 8 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 6 + Con modifier per level</p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 3</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Dexterous:</strong> You excel at tasks requiring nimble fingers and precise eye-hand coordination. Each time you spend 1 action die to boost a Dexterity-based skill check, you roll and add the results of 2 dice (e.g. at Career Level 1, 1d4 becomes 2d4).</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>Very, Very Sneaky:</strong> At Level 1, each time you fail an Acrobatics or Sneak check and don’t suffer an error, you still succeed as long as the check DC (or your opponent’s check result) is equal to or less than your Class Level + 20. If several grades of success are possible, you achieve only the lowest possible positive result.</p><p>If you gain this ability for either skill from two or more classes, add together your levels in all classes granting the ability when determining its effect.</p><p><strong>Evasion I:</strong> At Level 2, whenever you aren’t flat-footed and make a successful Reflex save to reduce damage, you suffer no damage at all.</p><p><strong>Evasion II:</strong> At Level 11, whenever you aren’t flat-footed and fail a Reflex save to reduce damage, you suffer only 1/2 damage (rounded down). </p><p><strong>Evasion III:</strong> At Level 19, you may forego rolling when making a Reflex save, instead setting your result to your Reflex save bonus + 10.</p><p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> You’re focused and cunning, engaging in larceny and assault with equal ease. At Levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, you gain 1 additional Melee Combat or Covert feat.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge I:</strong> Your senses are supremely sharp, letting you react quickly to danger. At Level 4, you retain your Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any) even when flat-footed.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge II:</strong> At Level 8, you never become flanked.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge III:</strong> At Level 12, you gain a +4 bonus with Reflex saves made to avoid traps, as well as a +4 bonus to Defense against attacks made by traps.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge IV:</strong> At Level 16, the first time in each scene when an attack reduces you to 0 or fewer wounds, the attack instead misses you.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge V:</strong> At Level 20, you never become flatfooted and may not be targeted with Coup de Grace actions unless you’re held, paralyzed, or unconscious.</p><p><strong>Bag of Tricks:</strong> You know a hundred ways to use the shadows to your advantage. At Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, you may choose 1 of the following abilities. Each of these abilities may be chosen only once. </p><p><em>• Bloody Mess:</em> You inflict particularly heinous wounds. At the start of each round when an opponent is bleeding from one of your attacks, he suffers additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p><p><em>• Expertise:</em> Choose one: Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Crafting, Haggle, Investigate, Notice, Prestidigitation, Ride, Search, Sneak, or Tactics. Taking 10 with this skill doesn’t take twice as long and taking 20 takes only 10 times as long.</p><p><em>• He Did It!:</em> When you successfully Taunt an opponent you may force him to attack any character adjacent to you (other than himself). You may use this ability a number of times per scene equal to your starting action dice.</p><p><em>• Look Out!:</em> Each ally and teammate within 10 ft. who can see and hear you gains the benefits of uncanny dodge I. This does not stack with uncanny dodge abilities they already have.</p><p><em>• Slippery:</em> You often trip opponents up with their own attacks. Once per round when an adjacent opponent’s attack misses you by 5 or more, you may immediately attempt to Tire the opponent as a free action. You may substitute Acrobatics in place of Resolve for this action.</p><p><em>• Sneak Attack:</em> You gain an additional die of sneak attack damage.</p><p><em>• Stick Close</em> and Don’t Make a Sound: When you make a Sneak check, a single adjacent ally or teammate may share your result. The character must remain within 10 ft. of you to retain this benefit.</p><p><em>• Stash it:</em> As a free action, you may make a Stash check to hide 1 object weighing up to 1 lb. Inspection fails to find the object unless a threat or critical success is scored.</p><p><strong>I’ll Cut You! I:</strong> At Level 10, each time you successfully Anticipate, Disarm, Distract, Feint, Taunt, or Tire an adjacent opponent, he must also make a Reflex save (DC 10 + the number of Covert feats you possess + your Dex modifier) or begin bleeding.</p><p><strong>I’ll Cut You! II:</strong> At Level 20, if the opponent fails the save and is already bleeding, he is stunned for 1 round. </p><p><strong>Prince of Thieves:</strong> You’ve carved out a tidy little empire for yourself. At Level 14, your maximum Prizes increase by 4 and you gain 400 Reputation that must immediately be spent on contacts, holdings, or magic items.</p><h4>Table 1.6: The Burglar</h4><table

all adventurers live and die by the sword; some, like the Courtier, prefer to exploit words. This silken-tongued schemer is part nobleman and part swindler, manipulating the dreams and desires of friend and foe alike. His plots shape kingdoms, make fortunes, incite riots, destroy reputations, and shatter worlds.</p><p>Depending on your campaign, a Courtier could be...</p><p>• An eloquent aristocrat whose family has navigated the royal court for generations</p><p>• A cunning criminal mastermind amassing a horde of ill-gotten gold</p><p>• A fiery revolutionary leading the people against an evil tyrant</p><p>• A well-spoken elder commanding the respect of many tribes</p><p>• A warrior-prince selling his devious services to the highest bidder</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Talker/Backer. Your golden tongue gives your party a decisive edge whenever a changed mind or a new perspective might save the day (or your skins). You can influence anyone, anywhere — even the heat of battle — and the incredible diversity of your abilities ensures your party is never without options.</p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Charisma, Wisdom, Dexterity</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Bluff, Haggle, Impress, Intimidate, Investigate, Notice, Prestidigitation, Resolve, Ride, Sense Motive</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 6 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 9 + Con modifier per level</p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 3</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Only the Finest:</strong> You reputation relies on impressions — of you and your teammates. Your Appearance bonus and that of each teammate increases by 2.</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>With a Word:</strong> Shaping the thoughts and feelings of others is second nature to you. At Level 1, each time you fail a Haggle or Impress check and don’t suffer an error, you still succeed as long as the check DC (or your opponent’s check result) is equal to or less than your Class Level + 20. If several grades of success are possible, you achieve only the lowest possible positive result. </p><p>If you gain this ability for either skill from two or more classes, add together your levels in all classes granting the ability when determining its effect.</p><p><strong>Gifts and Favors I (city):</strong> At Level 2, you gain an additional pool of money equal to your Lifestyle × your Class Level × 5 silver at the beginning of each adventure that may only be spent on Supplies and bribes. This represents the wide array of tools at your disposal, from desired trinkets to making and calling in favors to leveraging your position and influence.</p><p><strong>Gifts and Favors II (city):</strong> At Level 11, you may also spend this money on Services.</p><p><strong>Gifts and Favors III (city):</strong> At Level 19, you’ve become a great patron and may also spend this money on Crafting checks. Obligations: You’ve developed a spanning web of debts and exchanges and can pull strings all over. At Levels 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19, you gain 30 Reputation that must be spent to purchase or improve contacts.</p><p><strong>Eloquence:</strong> At Levels 4, 12, and 20, the lower of your Intelligence or Charisma scores rises by 1.</p><p><strong>Rise to Power:</strong> At Levels 5, 9, 13, and 17, you gain 1 Lifestyle or your Noble Renown increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Power Play:</strong> If politics is war by other means then you’re a mighty general indeed. At Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, you may choose 1 of the following abilities. Each of these abilities may be chosen only once.</p><p><em>• Beguiling:</em> When you successfully Taunt a character, you may decline the standard result to have your target become fixated on you for 1d6 rounds. Special characters and villains may spend 1 action die to cancel this effect and become immune to this ability for the rest of the scene. If you gain this benefit from multiple sources, you may also damage the target once without interrupting his fixation (you may do this only once, no matter how many times you gain the benefit).</p><p><em>• Entourage:</em> You gain the Followers feat (see page 98), the NPC group consisting of Attendants (see page 244). You may gain the Followers feat a second time later, as your character options allow.</p><p><em>• Expertise:</em> Choose one: Bluff, Haggle, Impress, Intimidate, Investigate, Notice, Prestidigitation, Resolve, Ride, or Sense Motive. Taking 10 with this skill doesn’t take twice as long and taking 20 takes only 10 times as long.</p><p><em>• Hoard:</em> Your maximum Prizes increase by 2.</p><p><em>• Land and Title:</em> You receive a 20% discount when purchasing holdings. Also, NPCs automatically know your name and title.</p><p><em>• Man of the Court:</em> Once per adventure as a free action, you may gain a free Invitation Favor with a cost equal to your Class Level + 5. Unless used, this Favor is lost at the end of the scene.</p><p><em>• Slanderous:</em> The threat ranges of your Influence and Browbeat checks to reduce Disposition increase by your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).</p><p><em>• Sterling Reputation:</em> When you or your allies lose Reputation, the loss decreases by 2 (minimum 0).</p><p><strong>Master Plan I:</strong> At Level 8, once per adventure as a free action, you gain a number of bonus d4 action dice equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 2). These dice are lost if not spent by the end of the current scene.</p><p><strong>Master Plan II:</strong> At Level 16, these bonus action dice increase to d6s and you may distribute some or all of them to allies able to see or hear you.</p><p><strong>Master of Graces I:</strong> At Level 10, once per adventure as a free action, you may gain 2 temporary Style feats that last until the end of the adventure.</p><p><strong>Master of Graces II:</strong> At Level 20, you may use this ability once per scene and its benefits last until the end of the scene.</p><p><strong>Never Outdone:</strong> You really, really hate to lose. At Level 14, once per scene after making an opposed skill check but before the check is resolved, you may set your result to 1 higher than that of your opponent. This cannot result in an error or threat. If both characters use abilities that set their result based on the other character’s result, both abilities are expended without effect (canceling each other out).</p><p></p><h4>Table 1.8: The

At Level 1, each time you fail an Athletics or Search check and don’t suffer an error, you still succeed as long as the check DC (or your opponent’s check result) is equal to or less than your Class Level + 20. If several grades of success are possible, you achieve only the lowest possible positive result. </p><p>If you gain this ability for either skill from two or more classes, add together your levels in all classes granting the ability when determining its effect. </p><p><strong>Bookworm I:</strong> You can ‘walk up to the right part of a library’ or ‘flip open a book to the right page’ with eerie accuracy. At Level 2, you make Research checks in 1/2 the usual time (rounded up).</p><p><strong>Bookworm II:</strong> At Level 11, you may make Research checks in 1/4 the usual time (rounded up).</p><p><strong>Bookworm III:</strong> At Level 19, you may make Research checks in 1/10 the usual time (rounded up).</p><p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At Levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, you gain 1 additional Basic Combat or Chance feat.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge I:</strong> Your senses are supremely sharp, letting you react quickly to danger. At Level 4, you retain your Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any) even when flat-footed.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge II:</strong> At Level 8, you never become flanked.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge III:</strong> At Level 12, you gain a +4 bonus with Reflex saves made to avoid traps, as well as a +4 bonus to Defense against attacks made by traps.</p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge IV:</strong> At Level 16, the first time in each scene when an attack reduces you to 0 or fewer wounds, the attack instead misses you. </p><p><strong>Uncanny Dodge V:</strong> At Level 20, you never become flatfooted and may not be targeted with Coup de Grace actions unless you’re held, paralyzed, or unconscious.</p><p><strong>Rugged:</strong> At Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, your Constitution score rises by 1.</p><p><strong>Notebook:</strong> You keep a record of every interesting fact and detail you encounter, often referring to this notebook — or collection of scrolls, or other small reference tool — to help solve difficult puzzles or suggest unseen courses of action. At Level 10, once per session when you make a successful Research check, you also gain 1 clue about the target.</p><p>At Level 20, you may use this ability twice per session.</p><p><strong>Lifeline:</strong> You and your teammates often slip out of even the most shocking circumstances (largely) unscathed. At Level 14, the first time in each scene your vitality or that of an adjacent teammate drops below 0, it instead drops to 0 and they become flat-footed.</p><h4>Table 1.9: The Explorer</h4><table

every culture the most learned thinkers and builders set standards for trade, invention, healing, and other roots of culture. When these scholars scramble for an answer they look to the Keeper, a fiendishly clever academic icon whose knowledge is only eclipsed by his desire for more. With a greater view of the world than most ever envision, the Keeper turns facts into weapons, secrets into victory, and questions into adventure.</p><p>Depending on your campaign, a Keeper could be...</p><p>• A master artisan beloved and respected throughout the land</p><p>• A shrewd guild-master conducting trade in all the fair cities of the kingdom</p><p>• An astute general whose strategies seem unbeatable</p><p>• An astrologer guiding the tribe’s chieftain with clever plans and keen observations</p><p>• An honored riddle-master preserving the traditions of a lost world</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Specialist. You’re at your best focusing on a few skills and using them to run roughshod over the opposition. In most cases you’re also your party’s most skilled craftsman and healer, making you important just before and right after combat, though you know a few ways to help during as well.</p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Intelligence</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Bluff, Crafting, Haggle, Impress, Investigate, Medicine, Notice, Resolve, Search, Sense Motive, Survival, Tactics</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 8 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 6 + Con modifier per level</p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 2</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Teacher:</strong> You’re a skilled teacher, passing along practical lessons gleaned from your incredible store of knowledge. Once per scene as a free action, you may temporarily grant your teammates 1 of your Basic Skill Mastery feats until the end of the scene.</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>Man of Reason:</strong> You’re well-versed in the most advanced techniques of your time.

At Level 14, once per session, you may make 1 Intelligence-based skill check, automatically scoring a natural 20. This roll is a threat and may be activated as a critical success. You may not be forced to re-roll this natural 20. Also, if the check normally takes 5 minutes or less, you accomplish it as a free action.

man first rode, cavalry has decided the course of history. The Lancer exemplifies this, lording over the open battlefield and brutally trampling opponents. At the reins he’s an unbridled terror, able to push his mount to incredible, some might say “impossible” acts, but even on his feet he manages to give enemies pause. None are fiercer, more disciplined, or more ready to face death.</p><p>Depending on your campaign, a Lancer could be...</p><p>• A prosperous nomad scouting dangerous territory for his people, leading them from oasis to oasis</p><p>• A chivalrous knight errant for whom right makes might, and vice-versa</p><p>• A samurai warrior as comfortable on the battlefield as in the imperial court</p><p>• A bold tribesman taming mighty mammoths and unleashing their herds upon his enemies</p><p>• A wyrm-rider delivering news from village to village in a land overrun by evil</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Combatant/Talker. Your focus is mounted combat, blending your steed’s strengths with personal training in the art of war. Yet your skills aren’t limited to the battlefield — your martial techniques translate well to social confrontations, especially when you need to get someone to see things your way. </p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Strength, Charisma, Constitution</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Athletics, Impress, Intimidate, Notice, Resolve, Ride, Survival, Tactics</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 4 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 12 + Con modifier per level</p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 6</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Lifetime Companion:</strong> You gain a mount per the Animal Partner feat (see page 108). You may gain the Animal Partner feat a second time later, as your character options allow. Your mount is replaced at no cost if lost or killed. Also, you receive a 20% discount with mounts and mount-related gear.</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>Born in the Saddle:</strong> It takes tremendous ego to command nature, especially when it’s prone to bucking and crushing the meek; fortunately, these traits help with two-legged beasts as well. At Level 1, each time you fail an Intimidate or Ride check and don’t suffer an error, you still succeed as long as the check DC (or your opponent’s check result) is equal to or less than your Class Level + 20. If several grades of success are possible, you achieve only the lowest possible positive result.</p><p>If you gain this ability for either skill from two or more classes, add together your levels in all classes granting the ability when determining its effect.</p><p><strong>Mettle I:</strong> At Level 2, you gain the Armor Basics feat and your maximum Resolve rank increases to your Career Level + 6.</p><p><strong>Mettle II:</strong> At Level 11, you gain the Armor Mastery feat and your maximum Resolve rank increases to your Career Level + 7.</p><p><strong>Mettle III:</strong> At Level 19, you gain the Armor Supremacy feat and your maximum Resolve rank increases to your Career Level + 8.</p><p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> The art of war extends well beyond the battlefield. At Levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, you gain 1 additional Melee Combat or Style feat.</p><p><strong>Bred for War:</strong> At Level 4, you gain a +2 bonus with Refresh rolls. When mounted, this bonus increases to +4 and your mount also benefits from the action.<br />At Levels 8, 12, 16, and 20, this bonus increases by an additional +2.</p><p><strong>Promotion:</strong> At Levels 6, 12, and 18, you gain 1 Renown rank of your choice.</p><p><strong>Excellence:</strong> At Levels 9 and 15, your highest attribute rises by 1.</p><p><strong>Master Rider:</strong> Together, you and your steed can accomplish the impossible! At Levels 10 and 20, once per session when riding a mount, you automatically succeed with 1 Ride check (DC up to 50).</p><p><strong>Last Stand:</strong> At Level 14, once per adventure as a full action, you may declare a last stand. For a number of rounds equal to your Class Level, you and each hero within 10 ft. suffer only 1/2 damage after Damage Reduction and Damage Resistance are applied (rounded down).</p><p>Also, you — but not affected heroes — may continue to act normally even if your wounds drop below 0. At the end of the last stand you become fatigued. You still die if you have less than –9 wounds.</p><h4>Table 1.11: The Lancer</h4><table style=\"width:100%;height:357px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td

mysterious figure in robes decorated with symbols of power, the studious scholar of lost secrets, the master of magical forces great and small, the Mage is all these things and more.

Priest is a shaman, druid, cleric, acolyte, or other purveyor of the faith who anchors communities and conveys the will of the universe. His power derives from his close connection to the divine; the strength of his faith grants access to special skills, strange and sometimes magical powers, and even miracles. The particulars of these abilities depend on the Priest’s faith — if he’s devoted to nature he might be a healer, for example, but if he follows an evil trickster god his offerings could include perversions of the mind and body. </p><p>Depending on your campaign, a Priest could be...</p><p>• A humble parishioner tending the faith of a small community at the edge of an expanding empire of unbelievers</p><p>• A fledgling warrior-monk seeking enlightenment and grace in a savage world</p><p>• An armored cleric, healing the pious and converting or eliminating unbelievers across the land</p><p>• A beleaguered chaplain treating the bodies and souls of soldiers during a bitter war</p><p>• The most renowned healer in a major city, trading the gifts of his faith for a life of luxury</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Wildcard/Backer. Your class abilities often provide direct or indirect support to your teammates, though your specific role largely depends on the Paths you walk. Common choices include War and Strength, which are helpful to holy warriors, and Protection and Life, which fit the classic “cleric” role.</p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Miracles campaign quality, Alignment (see page 61)</p><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Each level in this class increases your Casting Level by 1.</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Impress, Intimidate, Medicine, Notice, Resolve, Sense Motive, Alignment skills</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 6 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 9 + Con modifier per level</p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 4</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Devout:</strong> You’ve been appointed by a higher power to represent divine will in the world of mortals. This divine will is sometimes felt in the form of miracles. When you fail an attack check with your ritual weapon or a skill check with a Priest class skill and don’t suffer an error, you may spend an action die to re-roll the check. You may use this ability only once per check.</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>Acolyte:</strong> At Level 1, you take the first Step along any 1 of your Alignment’s Paths and gain your Alignment’s ritual weapon at no cost. This weapon may not be sold and when it’s lost or destroyed it’s replaced at no cost at the end of the next Downtime lasting 1 day or more.</p><p><strong>Signs &amp; Portents I:</strong> You may contact higher powers for guidance in times of need. At Level 2, as a 1-minute action, you may request a hint from the GM. If he refuses, you gain 1 bonus action die. You may use this ability a number of times per adventure equal to your starting action dice.</p><p><strong>Signs &amp; Portents II:</strong> At Level 11, if the GM refuses, you gain 2 action dice.</p><p><strong>Signs &amp; Portents III:</strong> At Level 19, if the GM refuses, you gain 3 action dice.</p><p><strong>Path of the Devoted:</strong> At Levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, you take a Step along any 1 of your Alignment’s Paths.</p><p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, you gain 1 additional Chance or Style feat.</p><p><strong>Masks of God:</strong> At Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, you may choose one of the following abilities. Each of these abilities may be chosen only once.</p><p><em>• Benediction:</em> You extend divine blessings to close friends. The error ranges of checks made by allies within Close Quarters decrease by 1 (minimum 1).</p><p><em>• Congregation:</em> You gain the Followers feat (see page 98), the NPC group consisting of Worshippers (see page 248). You may gain the Followers feat a second time later, as your character options allow.</p><p><em>• Exemplar:</em> You’re an ideal of your faith. The threat ranges of checks you make with your Alignment’s skills increase by 1.</p><p><em>• Fell Hand:</em> You’re a conduit of divine wrath. When attacking with your ritual weapon, you benefit from the All-Out Attack and Cleave Basics feats (see page 87).</p><p><em>• High Priest:</em> Your piety has earned you the flock’s respect and admiration. The Disposition of any NPC sharing your Alignment improves by 5.</p><p><em>• Perceptive:</em> Your Wisdom score rises by 1.</p><p><em>• Rebuke:</em> You’re an instrument of divine spite. Characters you successfully Turn also suffer an amount of divine damage equal to your Resolve bonus; those targeted who make their Will saves suffer half this damage (rounded down). You may only choose this ability if you may Turn.</p><p><em>• Sacred Turning:</em> Choose a Type from the following list: animal, beast, construct, elemental, fey, horror, ooze, outsider, plant, spirit, or undead. Once per combat you may Turn characters of this Type or an opposing Alignment (see page 309).</p><p><em>• Sacred Weapon:</em> You’re a divine champion, your ritual weapon possessing extraordinary gifts. You may not be disarmed when wielding your ritual weapon. Also, when the weapon is lost or destroyed it’s replaced at the start of the next scene.</p><p><em>• Visitation:</em> Once per adventure, you may spend 10 minutes in prayer to summon your Alignment’s avatar (see page 309). The avatar is a standard character with a Threat Level equal to your Class Level and remains until dismissed or until the end of the scene, whichever comes first.</p><p><strong>Saved! I:</strong> Your divine bond infuses your party with piercing judgment. At Level 10, your Wisdom score rises by 1. Also, when you or a hero who can see and hear you makes a Will save and the result is less than your Wisdom score, the result becomes equal to your Wisdom score.</p><p><strong>Saved! II:</strong> At Level 20, your Wisdom score rises by 1 more (total increase 2), and this ability also applies to Fortitude saves.</p><p><strong>Divine Intervention:</strong> You may call upon your gods for direct assistance. At Level 14, once per adventure, you may cast the Wish II spell without making a Spellcasting check, spending spell points or completing the Quest Subplot (see page 151).</p><h4>Table 1.13: The Priest</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td>Lvl</td><td>BAB</td><td>Fort</td><td>Ref</td><td>Will</td><td>Def</td><td>Init</td><td>Style</td><td>Legend</td><td>Abilities</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td><a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"fantasycraft.classfeatures\" data-uuid=\"Compendium.fantasycraft.classfeatures.EUSsJRUa9blF48tm\" data-id=\"EUSsJRUa9blF48tm\">Acolyte</a>, <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"fantasycraft.classfeatures\" data-uuid=\"Compendium.fantasycraft.classfeatures.qVvijyK3KRdzDRmZ\" data-id=\"qVvijyK3KRdzDRmZ\">Devout</a></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td><td>+3</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td><a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"fantasycraft.classfeatures\" data-uuid=\"Compendium.fantasycraft.classfeatures.lvlSFMDnx1UC6O9K\" data-id=\"lvlSFMDnx1UC6O9K\">Signs &amp;

At Level 1, so long as a teammate can hear or see you when he makes an attack, skill check, save, or damage roll, you may spend and roll 1 action die to boost his result. You always roll this die and add your own action die modifiers; the teammate’s die type and modifiers are ignored.

Examples include the appearance of a contact, the introduction of a major hint, a 4-die Complication that plagues your team’s opponents, or an automatic success with a skill check (even if the

endure the wilds as casually as the Scout and none but he truly thrive. He’s as comfortable atop northern glaciers as deep in swamp lakes, fearing nothing in nature — not weather or beasts, not even the threatening promise of empty night. He can live off the land almost indefinitely and employs wild, unpredictable tactics most “civilized” adventurers never even consider.</p><p>Depending on your campaign, a Scout could be...</p><p>• A military forward reconnoitering ahead of a massive army </p><p>• A bounty hunter seeking escaped mages</p><p>• The only guide to have escaped a band of frost giants and their snowy mountain gauntlet</p><p>• A grizzled monster hunter stalking creatures of nightmare in dungeons and deep jungles</p><p>• A canny tunnel denizen using guerilla warfare to protect a non-human enclave from folk incursions</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Combatant/Solver. You stand out away from the hustle-bustle of cities, taking advantage of terrain and finding strategy where others find impediment. Better yet, you extend many of your most powerful abilities to the rest of your party, keeping them one step ahead in rough country.</p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Acrobatics, Athletics, Blend, Medicine, Notice, Resolve, Ride, Sneak, Survival, Tactics</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 6 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 9 + Con modifier per level</p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 4</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Trailblazer:</strong> Your presence ensures that everyone survives even the most hostile environments. Once per scene as a free action, you may temporarily grant your teammates 1 of your Terrain feats until the end of the scene.</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>Stalker:</strong> At Level 1, each time you fail a Survival or Tactics check and don’t suffer an error, you still succeed as long as the check DC (or your opponent’s check result) is equal to or less than your Class Level + 20. If several grades of success are possible, you achieve only the lowest possible positive result.</p><p>If you gain this ability for either skill from two or more classes, add together your levels in all classes granting the ability when determining its effect.</p><p><strong>Rough Living:</strong> Your time in the wild has toughened you. At Level 2, you gain a +2 bonus to Defense, as well as with saves prompted by the environment.</p><p>At Levels 11 and 19, these bonuses increase by an additional +2 (to +4 at Level 11 and +6 at Level 19).</p><p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At Levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, you gain 1 additional Ranged Combat or Terrain feat. Sneak Attack: At Level 4, you gain an additional die of sneak attack damage.</p><p>At Levels 8, 12, 16, and 20, you gain another additional die of sneak attack damage.</p><p><strong>Huntsman:</strong> At Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, you may choose 1 of the following abilities. Each of these abilities may be chosen only once.</p><p><em>• Darkvision I:</em> You ignore the effects of dim and faint light.</p><p><em>• Expertise:</em> Choose one skill: Acrobatics, Athletics, Blend, Medicine, Notice, Resolve, Ride, Sneak, Survival, or Tactics. Taking 10 with this skill doesn’t take twice as long and taking 20 takes only 10 times as long.</p><p><em>• Keen Senses:</em> Your visual, hearing, and scent range increments increase by 20 ft.</p><p><em>• Killing Blow:</em> It costs you 1 fewer action dice to activate a critical hit against an animal, elemental, fey, ooze, or plant (minimum 0).</p><p><em>• Master Handler:</em> You’re considered to have 5 additional ranks in Survival when training animals. This may cause you to exceed your maximum skill rank for these activities.</p><p>• Rough Riding: Your vehicle or mount ignores Speed penalties from terrain (see page 371).</p><p>• Sprint: In combat, your Speed increases by 10 ft.</p><p>• Trail Signs: You suffer no penalties for Speed when making Track checks.</p><p>• Trophy Hunter: You can drop even the biggest game with a single attack. When you attack an animal, your threat range increases by 3.</p><p>• Turning: Your pleasant relationship with the natural world is... discretionary. Choose a Type from the following list: animal, elemental, fey, ooze, or plant. Once per combat you may Turn characters of this Type (see page 223).</p><p><strong>Master Tracker:</strong> You frequently have uncanny insight about your prey. At Level 10, once per session when you make a successful Track check, you also gain 1 clue about the target (see page 335).</p><p>At Level 20, you may use this ability twice per session.</p><p><strong>Overrun:</strong> You know the first few seconds of any fight are critical. At Level 14, once per session at the start of combat, you may declare that you’re “overrunning.” While overrunning, if one of your attacks or a teammate’s kills an opponent or knocks them unconscious, the attacker may immediately make an additional attack with the same weapon against another opponent. This continues until you and your teammates gain a combined number of additional attacks equal to your Class Level.</p><h4>Table 1.15: The Scout</h4><table style=\"width:100%;height:357px\"

Soldier inhabits a bloody twilight realm of endless warfare, slashing and crushing his way from one bitter struggle to the next. Even when at relative “peace” he’s always preparing, always on the lookout for the next fight, and this vigilance is part of what makes him such a godsend to fellow adventurers. Nothing levels the field of battle like a well-honed Soldier, except perhaps two Soldiers.</p><p>Depending on your campaign, a Soldier could be...</p><p>• A veteran legionnaire bearing decades of war scars</p><p>• A plucky young squire seeking to prove himself through feats of arms and daring</p><p>• A martial arts master committed to enlightenment through the perfection of his fighting technique</p><p>• A tribal warrior defending his people from ancient foes</p><p>• A gladiatorial champion, calling for any and all takers</p><p><strong>Party Role:</strong> Combatant. You’re the ultimate general warrior. With strong fighting stats and abilities, you’re the perfect complement to any party that regularly brawls. You’re not initially the best at any particular aspect of battle (though you can easily reach that goal); rather, you’re strong in all categories.</p><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Strength, Dexterity, Constitution (though not always in that order)</p><p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> Athletics, Crafting, Intimidate, Notice, Resolve, Search, Survival, Tactics</p><p><strong>Skill Points:</strong> 4 + Int modifier per level (×4 at Career Level 1)</p><p><strong>Vitality:</strong> 12 + Con modifier per level </p><p><strong>Starting Proficiencies:</strong> 6</p><h1>CORE ABILITY</h1><p><strong>Accurate:</strong> Your finely honed physique is your deadliest weapon. Each time you spend 1 action die to boost an attack check, you roll and add the results of 2 dice (e.g. at Career Level 1, 1d4 becomes 2d4).</p><h1>CLASS ABILITIES</h1><p><strong>Fight On:</strong> At Levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, you gain 1 additional Basic, Melee, Ranged, or Unarmed Combat feat or 2 additional proficiencies.</p><p><strong>Fortunes of War I:</strong> You stand fast in battle, especially when the pressure’s on. At Level 2, you gain Damage Reduction 1. During dramatic scenes, this DR increases to 2. </p><p><strong>Fortunes of War II:</strong> At Level 11, your Damage Reduction increases to 2 (4 during dramatic scenes).</p><p><strong>Fortunes of War III:</strong> At Level 19, your Damage Reduction increases to 3 (6 during dramatic scenes).</p><p><strong>Armor Use I:</strong> At Level 4, you gain a +1 bonus to Defense while wearing armor and receive a 20% discount when purchasing armor.</p><p><strong>Armor Use II:</strong> At Level 8, this Defense bonus increases to +2 and this discount increases to 25%.</p><p><strong>Armor Use III:</strong> At Level 12, this Defense bonus increases to +3 and this discount increases to 30%.</p><p><strong>Armor Use IV:</strong> At Level 16, this Defense bonus increases to +4 and this discount increases to 35%.</p><p><strong>Armor Use V:</strong> At Level 20, this Defense bonus increases to +5 and this discount increases to 40%.</p><p><strong>Weapon Specialist:</strong> Your knowledge of weapons in which you’re trained is expansive and precise. At Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, you may choose 1 of the following abilities. Each of these abilities may be chosen only once.</p><p><em>• Certainty:</em> Your error range with proficient attacks decreases by 2 (minimum 0).</p><p><em>• Decisive Attack:</em> Once per round when holding a weapon in which you’re proficient, you may make 1 free attack against a standard character.</p><p><em>• Killer Instinct:</em> You inflict 2 additional damage with proficient attacks.</p><p><em>• Master Weaponsmith:</em> You’re considered to have 5 additional ranks in Crafting when building, improving, or repairing weapons in which you’re proficient. This may cause you to exceed your maximum skill rank for these activities.</p><p><em>• Most Deadly:</em> It costs you 1 fewer action dice to activate critical hits with proficient attacks (minimum 0).</p><p><em>• One Step Ahead:</em> You gain a +1 dodge bonus to Defense and DR 1 against attacks with weapons in which you’re proficient.</p><p><em>• Rugged Weapons:</em> When you’re holding a weapon in which you’re proficient and it must make a Damage save, you may roll twice, keeping the result you prefer.</p><p><em>• Shrewd Buyer:</em> You receive a 20% discount when purchasing weapons in which you’re proficient.</p><p><strong>Portable Cover I:</strong> You make the most of terrain, even improvising cover from objects kicked, knocked, or thrown into the path of incoming attacks. At Level 10, you and each ally within 10 ft. is considered to have 1/4 cover at all times, even when standing in the open. This benefit is lost while you’re flatfooted. </p><p><strong>Portable Cover II:</strong> At Level 20, this ability grants 1/2 cover and affects allies within 15 ft.</p><p><strong>One in a Million:</strong> You turn nearly any battlefield opportunity into savage amounts of pain. At Level 14, once per session, you may make 1 attack check, Fortitude save, or Strength- or Constitution-based skill check, automatically scoring a natural 20. This roll is a threat and may be activated as a critical success. You may not be forced to re-roll this natural 20.</p><h4>Table 1.16: The Soldier</h4><table style=\"width:100%;height:357px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td

You can read and write any language you know unless you intentionally choose not to, perhaps as a way of expanding your character’s background.</p><p><strong>Studies:</strong> Each Interest not defined as an Alignment or a Language is a Study — something your character takes time to learn about. A Study can focus on a nation or region, a culture, a celebrated adventurer, a religion, a monster, an adversary, or anything else you and the GM feel is appropriate.</p><p>Each Study should be broad enough to find periodic use in the setting and story but narrow enough not to enter every conversation.

The art of building takes a lifetime to master, but unveils treasures that in all the world stand unique — for a time.</p><p><strong>Focuses:</strong> When a character gains his first rank in Crafting and for every 4 full ranks he gains in total, he learns 1 focus from the following list: Carving (bone objects), Carpentry (wood objects), Chemistry (chemical objects, like gunpowder and explosives), Cooking (food), Inscription (documents, including books and paintings), Metalworking (metal objects), Pharmacy (medical supplies and poisons), Pottery (clay and ceramic objects), Stonecutting (stone objects), Tailoring (cloth and leather objects). The GM may add additional focuses as the campaign warrants. Each Crafting skill check uses only 1 focus (making primarily metal armor uses only Metalworking, for example, even if the resulting item has leather parts), and all checks made without the appropriate focus are untrained (see page 63).</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> A character without the corresponding kit for the focus he’s using is considered untrained even when he has Crafting ranks (see page 63).

(see page 73). A critical success yields an additional 50% (rounded up) and a critical failure yields 50% less (rounded down). Should the character have any raw materials the GM feels are appropriate to the task (see page 356), he may apply some or all of their value towards to this total. He may also spend coin to increase the total, though the combined value of applied raw materials and coin cannot exceed the original amount rolled (i.e. the character may not do better than double his total with raw materials and coin).</p><p>If the total Crafting Value after all modifications is equal to or higher than the desired object’s cost, the character builds as many of the object as the Value can buy. Any leftover Value is converted to coin or added to the character’s Reputation. At the GM’s discretion, the character may “bank” Value toward a particularly large or complex item but this significantly increases bookkeeping and is only recommended for advanced games. If banking is allowed and the character abandons a crafting enterprise before it’s completed, he may sell the parts off for 1/2 the Value banked toward the item to date (rounded down), or convert the same Value to raw materials (see page 356).</p><h2>COUNTERFEIT (DOWNTIME)</h2><p>This works like a Build check, except that when the object is ready an observer can make a Notice or Search check to realize it’s a fake.

An item must be inactive (or in the case of locks and traps, Disabled) before it may be Dismantled.</p><p>Dismantling an item takes a number of hours equal to the item’s Complexity divided by 5 (rounded up). With success against the item’s Complexity, the item is destroyed and the character gains raw materials of an appropriate type equal to 1/2 the item’s value (rounded down).</p><p>With a critical success, the character gains raw materials equal to the item’s value. With a critical failure, the item is destroyed but the character gains no raw materials.</p><h2>IMPROVISE (1 FULL ACTION)</h2><p>A character may only improvise items with a Complexity of 5D or 7D and may not attempt this check in a barren location (e.g. a prison cell or a desert). The GM must approve all Improvise checks before the roll is made (some items simply can’t be improvised and certain situations prevent certain attempts).</p><p>With success against the item’s Complexity, the character gains an improvised version of the item that lasts until the end of the scene or until it suffers damage, whichever comes first. All checks made with the item are untrained and the error ranges of all checks made with the item increase by 2.</p><p>With a critical success, this untrained limitation is lifted. With a critical failure, the character may not attempt to improvise the same item during this scene.</p><h2>REPAIR (DOWNTIME)</h2><p>This works like a Build check, except that each item is repaired at 1/2 the cost to build it (rounded down).</p><p></p><h4>Table 2.9: Crafting</h4><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Downtime*</strong></p><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Result</th><th>Per Day</th><th>Per Week</th><th>Per Month</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Up to 15</td><td>1s/—</td><td>10s/0</td><td>50s/0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">16–25</td><td>3s/—</td><td>30s/0</td><td>150s/1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">26–35</td><td>6s/—</td><td>60s/1</td><td>300s/2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">36–45</td><td>10s/—</td><td>100s/1</td><td>500s/3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">46+</td><td>15s/—</td><td>150s/1</td><td>750s/4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Silver Crafting Value is to the left of the slash and Reputation is to the right.

Puzzles often hide traps and locks, requiring a character to Decipher before he can Disable (see page 79). Many puzzles are Complex Tasks (see page 67), demanding the character locate various clues or unravel pieces of the greater mystery before solving the whole.</p><p>The GM should tailor each puzzle for the story in which it appears and ideally make solving it an unfolding adventure. The previously mentioned word clue, for example, might involve letters inscribed on the tatters of provincial flags mutilated during a peace accord at the kingdom’s capital city — arranging the letters in the order that the ambassadors of each province arrived at the capital spells out the name of a chambermaid who’s unwittingly delivering diseased bedding to the chambers of the royals. In this scenario, finding the letters is just the beginning. Likewise, the thieves’ code could be a substitution alphabet cross-referencing the dates of the guild’s greatest heists with the values of each take, and thus investigating the guild helps to decrypt the code. The pech portal might demand a gem from each of the tribe’s settlements, all of which are long buried, trap laden, and monster-infested.</p><p>A puzzle is best roleplayed, though there isn’t always the time or inspiration to develop one that’s stimulates the players without stumping them. When a skill check is desired, the time and DC are based on the puzzle’s difficulty, as shown on Table 2.14: Puzzles (see above). Success finds the solution, while failure increases the error range of future attempts by 2 per action die spent.</p><p>With a critical success, the attempt takes half the listed time (rounded down). With a critical failure, the character is stumped and may not attempt to Decipher the same puzzle again during this scene.</p><h4>Table 2.14: Puzzles</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Difficulty</th><th>Time</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Trivial</td><td>1d6 rounds</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Challenging</td><td>1d6 minutes</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Grueling</td><td>4d6 minutes</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Maddening</td><td>1d6 hours</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>IDENTIFY (VARIES)</h2><p>Adventuring is a dangerous career. Beyond the myriad adversaries that must be put down, the wild and hostile creatures defending their homes and hunting grounds, the traps, treachery, and the very environment itself, characters must keep a wary eye on their loot. Is that a Righteous Sword of Holy Vengeance or a Backbiting Barb of Betrayal? Many found items are a mystery until they’re used — or identified. This check offers a safe if not speedy alternative to discovering an item’s true nature the hard way.</p><p>Identifying an item takes a number of minutes equal to the item’s Complexity (if non-magical), or a number of hours equal to its Reputation Cost (if magical). This value also acts as this check’s DC (note that the value is likely known only to the GM when this check is made). With success, the character accurately identifies the item, including all statistics. With failure, the error ranges of future attempts increase by 2 per action die spent.</p><p>With a critical success, the attempt takes half the listed time (rounded down). With a critical failure, the character is stumped and may not attempt to Identify the same item again during this scene.</p><h2>RESEARCH (VARIES)</h2><p>Rummaging through stacks of dusty tomes in a long-forgotten library, pouring over battle manuals in a warlord’s training hall, and tracing the history of a dead civilization through glyphs scrawled on a jungle temple’s walls — all these are examples of Research in action. Sometimes the GM will build Research checks directly into an adventure, as a necessary step forward (e.g. finding a scroll the characters need to defeat a lich); other times, a player may Research a topic when he has details but can’t piece them together (in this way a Research check becomes the inverse of a Game Master hint — see page 366).</p><p>A Research check’s DC and the time needed to make the check are based on the information sought and where the character looks for it, as shown on Table 2.15: Researching (see below). Success yields a clue, while failure increases the error range of future attempts by 2 per action die spent.</p><p>With a critical success, the attempt takes half the listed time (rounded down). With a critical failure, the character is stumped and may not attempt to Research the same topic again during this scene.</p><p>Some Research checks are doomed to failure — looking for a clue that doesn’t exist, for instance. The GM is under no obligation to inform the players when a clue isn’t available, before or after the check; the only true confirmation is success (and not even that if the GM decides to keep the DC secret).</p><h4><strong>Table 2.15: Researching</strong></h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Circumstances</th><th>Time</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Research Area</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Single book, scroll, tablet, etc.</td><td>1d6 hours</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Several books, scrolls, tablets, etc.</td><td>2d6 hours</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Dozens of books, scrolls, tablets, etc.</td><td>4d6 hours</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hundreds of books, scrolls, tablets, etc.</td><td>1d6 days</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Thousands of books, scrolls, tablets, etc.</td><td>4d6 days</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Well organized</td><td>×1/2 base time *</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Disorganized</td><td>2 × base time *</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Desired information is...</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Linked to all other topics in area</td><td>×1/4 base time</td><td>–10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Linked to most other topics in area</td><td>×1/2 base time</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Linked to some other topics in area</td><td>Base time</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Linked to a few other topics in area</td><td>2 × base time</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Linked to no other topics in area</td><td>4 × base time</td><td>+10</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Applied before the desired information modifier</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1200000,"name":"Medicine","type":"text","_id":"vcqxuS2JU0BLAeH2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>MEDICINE (INT)</h1><p>Sooner or later every adventurer gets hurt.

With a critical success, the target heals 4d6 damage. With a critical failure, the target suffers 1d6 lethal damage. A character may only be targeted by 1 Mend check per day.</p><h2>STABILIZE (1 FULL ACTION)</h2><p>This check is used to stabilize a dying or poisoned character, staving death off long enough for more substantial treatment. It can be used two ways.</p><p>• Stabilize Dying Character: With success (DC 15), the character stabilizes 1 dying special character at 0 wound points (unconscious). With a critical success, the target wakes up and recovers 1d6 wound points. With a critical failure, the target dies. This check may not target a standard character.</p><p>• Stabilize Poisoned Character: With success against the save DC, the character freezes 1 poison victim’s current Incubation Period for 2 hours — long enough for a Treatment check. With a critical success, the poison’s Incubation Period freezes for 4 hours. With a critical failure, the stabilizing character is exposed to the poison.</p><h2>TREATMENT (DOWNTIME)</h2><p>This check is used to speed an injured character’s recovery and treat serious maladies. With 2 hours of Downtime, a character can perform one of the following treatments. A character may only be targeted by 1 Treatment check per day.</p><p>• Speed Natural Healing: With success (DC 15), the character doubles 1 special character’s natural healing rate for the day. With a critical success, the target’s natural healing rate is tripled for the day. With a critical failure, the target suffers 1d6 lethal damage. This check may not target a standard character.</p><p>• Treat Attribute Impairment: With success (DC 15 + 5 per point of impairment with 1 attribute), the character heals 1 character of 1d4 points of temporary impairment or 1 point of permanent impairment. With a critical success, the character heals all temporary impairment or 1d4 points of permanent impairment. With a critical failure, the character inflicts 1 point of permanent impairment. In all cases, the target becomes sickened for 1d6 days after the treatment.</p><p>• Treat Critical Injury: With success (DC 20), the character decreases 1 critical injury’s healing time by 1 month. With a critical success, the injury’s healing time decreases by 2 months. With a critical failure, the injury’s healing time increases by 2 months. In all cases, the target becomes sickened for 1d6 days after the treatment.</p><p>• Treat Poison or Disease: With success against the save DC, the character grants a +2 bonus with Fortitude saves against the contagion. With a critical success, the victim fully recovers at the end of the current Incubation Period. With a critical failure, the character is exposed to the contagion. This check may be performed up to 5 times per victim, with cumulative bonuses.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil falls victim to a carnivorous plant’s venom. His companion, Gholin, makes a successful Treat Poison check against the venom’s save DC, granting Brungil a +2 bonus with Fortitude saves against the disease. Sadly, Brungil still fails his next save against the contagion, so Gholin makes another Assist Recovery check. Once again he’s successful, granting Brungil another +2 (for a total of +4). Unless Brungil manages a successful save or dies, this process may continue until Gholin affords Brungil the maximum +10 bonus against the disease. Thereafter, poor Brungil’s on his own.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1700000,"name":"Notice","type":"text","_id":"k0NmfwZG1y6V8xjC","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>NOTICE (WIS)</h1><p>This skill is used to subconsciously detect things — it comes into play whenever it’s important to know whether the character sees, hears, or otherwise senses important details without looking for them.

Each Ride skill check uses only 1 focus and all checks made without the appropriate focus are untrained (see page 63).</p><p><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Mount species and vehicle types, plus their capabilities and limits; stunts and tricks; trade and travel routes (safest and fastest, by region)</p><h2>MANEUVER (1 HALF ACTION)</h2><p>Most of the time, no skill check is required to control a mount or vehicle. This check comes into play when the character attempts a risky maneuver, especially during combat or another dangerous situation.</p><p>A character may make a Maneuver check to perform any Acrobatics or Athletics check except Climb or Tumble while on a mount or using a vehicle, applying the additional modifiers shown on Table 2.17: Maneuvers (see page 81). Certain animals may not be able to perform certain maneuvers, depending on their NPC qualities (see page 230). A mounted character’s statistics merge with those of the animal (see page 215) and these combined stats are used when determining the effects of any maneuver.</p><p>With success, the mount or vehicle performs the desired check; otherwise, the character loses control and must make another half action Maneuver check (DC 20) to regain it. An out-of-control animal is directed by the GM, while an out-ofcontrol self-propelled vehicle moves its current Speed in a random direction, per the Deviation Diagram (see page 216). If this causes the vehicle to travel opposite its original course, it spins in place and comes to a stop at the end of the current round.</p><p>The effects of critical success or failure are also determined by the desired check, though the GM may alternately spend 2 action dice to cause the mount or vehicle to crash into the scenery, suffering 1d6 lethal damage per 10 ft. of current Speed. Each character on the mount or in the vehicle also suffers this damage — or half as much, rounded down, with a successful Reflex save (DC 15).</p><p>An animal allowed to roam freely uses its own Acrobatics and Athletics skill bonuses but the GM, rather than the player, determines its actions and movement.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil directs his pony to make a running horizontal Jump onto a rising drawbridge. He needs to clear 15 ft. to avoid an unfortunate dip in the moat below (currently filled with flaming oil). His Maneuver check result is 17, but he suffers a –10 penalty due to the close fire. This translates to 12 ft. of distance. Happily, the pony has a Speed of 40 ft. (1/3 higher than that of an average human), so it clears an additional 4 ft. (for a total of 16 ft.) — just enough to clear the bridge and prepare for a charge into the garrison’s militia.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Hours after leaving Lord Bloodpyre’s cherished shaman totem a smoldering husk in the courtyard of one of his garrisons, Brungil is still being pursued by the ogre’s cavalry. He needs to press his pony as hard as he can to make it safely back to Valespire. Sounds like an Athletics/Push Limit check. He scores a critical success with a Maneuver result of 26, which isn’t further modified (Brungil’s technically moving across open terrain but his mount is also moving faster than 1/2 its Speed). This offers him either +4 MPH to Speed for 1 hour or +2 MPH to Speed for 2 hours. He opts for the greater immediate Speed, planning to Push his pony again when it runs out. He’ll owe the little beast a special treat when they make it home safely.</p><h4><strong>Table 2.17: Maneuvers</strong></h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Circumstances</th><th>Check Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Check Attempted</th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Acrobatics/Balance</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Acrobatics/Break Fall</td><td>–10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Acrobatics/Jump</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Athletics/Push Limit</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Athletics/Swim</td><td>–4 (unless the animal is native to water)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Takes animal within 10 ft. of open flame</td><td>–10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Takes animal though open flame</td><td>–20</td></tr><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Maneuvering Room</th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Open (e.g. open plain, quiet road, wide canyon)</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Close (e.g. shallow stream, village street, narrow canyon)</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Crowded (e.g. light forest, quiet city street, courtyard)</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Tight (e.g. jungle, busy city street, cave or large dungeon hall)</td><td>–10</td></tr><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Animal is...</th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Moving faster than 1/2 its Speed (rounded down)</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Wild (see page 169)</td><td>–10</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"Skills","type":"text","_id":"4r3lZf40PAkMMJIL","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>SKILLS</h1><p>In his journeys, a hero does more than fend off the ravening legions of evil — he smooth-talks city guards, explores ancient crypts, and creeps through heavily guarded areas.

Priest may also purchase ranks in their Alignment skills (see page 309).</p><h2>BUYING SKILL RANKS</h2><p>Skill ranks are bought and improved with points granted by classes. A character may improve his skill ranks each time he gains a level, though he may only buy ranks in Origin and class skills (see pages 9 and 28). Each rank costs 1 skill point. The maximum number of ranks a character may possess in any skill is equal to his Career Level + 3.</p><p>In the unlikely event that a character cannot spend all the skill points he earns between levels, excess points are lost.</p><h2>SKILL BONUS</h2><p>A character’s bonus with a skill is equal to his ranks in it + his modifier with the skill’s key attribute (which may be negative). For a list of key attributes and other information, consult Table 2.1: Purchasing Skills (see page 64). The GM may change a skill’s key attribute whenever he feels a different one is more appropriate to the situation, meaning that a player’s skill bonus may change for certain attempts.</p><h2>SKILL CHECKS</h2><p>When a character uses a skill, he makes a “skill check,” rolling 1d20 and adding his appropriate skill bonus to obtain a skill check result. If the result equals or exceeds the attempt’s Difficulty Class or “DC” (which generally falls between 10 for a relatively simple action and 60 for an extremely tricky one), the character succeeds; otherwise, he fails. A character may only retry a failed check when the GM determines it’s plausible (e.g. retrying an Acrobatics check to jump at a tournament might be fine, but leaping across a chasm doesn’t offer much chance for a fresh effort).</p><p>Skill checks should only be made when the GM believes there is or should be a chance of failure — anything less and the character succeeds automatically.</p><h2>UNTRAINED SKILL USE</h2><p>A character with no ranks in a skill is considered “untrained.” He may attempt checks with the skill but his result cannot exceed 15 and his error range increases by 2.</p><h2>SKILL CHECK MODIFIERS</h2><p>A number of modifiers may apply to skill checks. Some are “named,” falling into one of the following categories, and others are “unnamed.” Unnamed bonuses stack but only the highest individual bonus and the highest individual penalty from each named category apply to each skill attempt.</p><p>• <strong>Discretionary:</strong> The GM can apply a –4 to +4 modifier to represent circumstances not covered by an existing rule. For example, he might apply +2 when a character makes an Impress check after a moving comment, or –4 when trying to direct a horse into a pitch black cave (–1) to escape trebuchet attacks falling nearby (–3). The GM is encouraged to use discretionary modifiers to make any skill attempt more interesting.</p><p>• <strong>Insight:</strong> Origins, class abilities, and feats offer these bonuses, which represent keen understanding of skill techniques.</p><p>• <strong>Gear:</strong> Gear and magic items trigger these modifiers.</p><p>• <strong>Magic:</strong> Spells and magic items impose these modifiers.</p><p>• <strong>Morale:</strong> Class abilities are responsible for most morale modifiers, which showcase confidence under pressure.</p><p>• <strong>Synergy:</strong> The GM may determine that one other skill complements the character’s attempt. For example, a character might benefit from Bluff when distracting a character to pick his pocket, an activity covered by Prestidigitation. If the character has at least 4 ranks in the supporting skill, he gains a +2 bonus.</p><h2>TAKING 10 AND TAKING 20</h2><p>Sometimes a character doesn’t want to chance failure so he takes his time. In this case he can “take 10,” which requires twice the normal time. He does not roll 1d20 when making the skill check; instead, his result is calculated as if he’d rolled a natural 10.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Lorelei has an Acrobatics skill bonus of +8 and faces a jump with a DC of 15. She chooses to take twice as long to set her result to 18 and automatically succeed.</p><p>Alternately, a character might have all the time in the world and want to take advantage of it. In this case he can “take 20,” which requires twenty times the normal time. As with taking 10 there is no roll; the result is calculated as if he’d rolled a natural 20.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Lorelei has a meager Impress skill bonus of +4 when she finds herself fortuitously snowed in at a prince’s home. She decides to take her time wooing him, taking 20 for a total result of 24. With any luck it’s high enough to turn his head.</p><p>In both cases there was no roll, so the character may not spend an action die to boost the result. Also, a character taking 10 or 20 may not score a threat nor be activated as a critical success (see right).</p><p>A character may not take 10 or 20 when distracted or endangered, nor may he do so when the GM determines that the element of chance is unavoidable. This option is also unavailable when making opposed, cooperative, and team checks (see page 66).</p><h2>MULTI-TASKING</h2><p>Sometimes a character must split his attention between multiple skill attempts — stabilizing a wounded friend while balancing on a precarious surface, for instance, or scanning a house for clues while listening for signs that the owner is lying to him. A character may split his attention between no more than two skill checks at a time and the GM must determine that any combination of skill checks is plausible. When multi-tasking, a character suffers a –5 penalty with both checks and his error range with each increases by 2.</p><h2>SPECIAL SKILL RESULTS</h2><p>Every skill check has an error range and a threat range, which are natural die results that trigger special skill results. Unless otherwise specified, a skill check has an error range of 1 and a threat range of 20, though character options, gear choices, and other effects may modify these base values. Bonuses expand the range of natural die rolls that trigger an error or threat, and penalties scale them back. Modifiers may not eliminate error and threat ranges.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A character’s error range with a particular skill check increases by 2 and his threat range increases by 1. Unless other modifiers are in play, the check has an error range of 1–3 and a threat range of 19–20.</p><h2>THREATS AND CRITICAL SUCCESSES</h2><p>When a skill check succeeds and the character rolls a natural number within his threat range (an actual roll of the number on a d20), he scores a threat — a potential critical success. To gain the benefits of a critical success, the character simply spends 1 or more action dice as listed in the skill description. No more than 4 action dice may be spent to activate any critical success. When no cost is listed a character only needs to spend 1 action die to gain the benefit.</p><p>The GM could alternately apply effects of his own, let the skill user describe what happens, or even poll the other players for suggestions, especially if he thinks the result will be more interesting or make more sense in the current circumstances. This also costs 1–4 action dice based on the outcome. Most critical successes should have descriptive and mechanical components, and most of the time they should contribute to the ongoing fun and action of the scene rather than ending either.</p><p>1 Action Die: Brungil scores a critical success with Sneak while evading a group of roving goblins in an enemy fortress. Rather than have him skip straight to the heart of the complex (thus ending the scene), the GM has the goblins pass unwittingly by his concealed position. Brungil may blindside the mob, benefiting from a successful Ambush (see page 83). Also, he maps a quarter of the area.</p><p>2 Action Dice: The goblins are so oblivious to Brungil’s presence that he can follow them back to the barracks, learning much about the fortress defenses. Any character with this information gains a +2 bonus with Blend, Sneak, and Tactics checks made inside the fortress during the next 24 hours. Also, Brungil maps about half the complex.</p><p>3 Action Dice: Not only can Brungil sneak into the barracks, he can spend 1 hour sabotaging the armory stockpiles to increase the error range of every goblin weapon by 2 and decrease the DR of all goblin armor by 2. He also maps all but the area’s most heavily guarded areas.</p><p>4 Action Dice: Brungil completes his map of the stronghold and may set successful Ambushes in any four locations of his choice. He can also scrawl an irritating message at a strategic location, allowing him to target the goblin’s warlord with a Taunt action when he emerges later in the adventure. Special Note: A threat scored by a standard NPC may only become a critical success if the NPC possesses the treacherous quality (see page 235).</p><h2>ERRORS AND CRITICAL FAILURES</h2><p>When a skill check fails and the character rolls a natural number within his error range (an actual roll of the number on a d20), or when a skill result is negative, the character suffers an error — a potential critical failure. He only suffers the effects of the critical failure, however, if his opponent — commonly the GM — spends 1 or more action dice as listed in the skill description. No more than 4 action dice may be spent to activate any critical failure. When no cost is listed, the opponent only needs to spend 1 action die to trigger the effect.</p><p>Critical failures are generally left to the GM’s discretion. The potential pitfall here is using a critical failure to punish the character — true failure is oppressive and demoralizing. A better option is to use the failure to stack the odds a little higher against the character and maybe his entire party. This offers more things for the characters to do and enhances the overall story. Here are some examples of what might happen if Brungil’s Sneak check resulted in a critical failure instead.</p><p>1 Action Die: The goblins notice Brungil and attack. The sound of battle attracts a second mob of goblins in 1d6 rounds.</p><p>2 Action Dice: The stronghold’s alarm horns sound at the start of the second round of battle. Even if Brungil makes it out of his current bind he suffers a –2 penalty with all Blend, Sneak, and Tactics checks in the fortress until the goblins lower their guard.</p><p>3 Action Dice: The alarm doesn’t sound but one goblin that Brungil didn’t spot — that the GM didn’t initially describe and that Brungil’s player doesn’t know about — slips out of sight before his companions attack. The goblin watches the fight and trails Brungil through the fortress afterward, studying him. Every five to ten minutes as Brungil continues through the fortress the GM makes a secret Notice check to see if the hero spots his pursuer. If he does he can try to capture or kill the goblin but if the creature remains hidden for at least three consecutive checks he returns to his superiors and reports his findings. For the rest of the adventure the threat range of every adversary in the fortress increases by 2 when targeting Brungil with attack and skill checks.</p><p>4 Action Dice: Brungil drops his least valuable silvereconomy item in an attempt to recover. Both goblin squads are alerted and the alarm sounds but the GM isn’t done. The item is found 1d4 hours later, allowing the goblin shamans to track Brungil’s precise location for the rest of the scene. If Brungil returns to his party, he and his friends may soon find themselves with some unexpected visitors…</p><h2>OPPOSED CHECKS</h2><p>When a character competes against someone else with a skill, he makes an “opposed check.” All involved make a standard skill check with the most relevant skill (e.g. Athletics for everyone in a foot race, Bluff for a lying character and Sense Motive for the listener, etc.), and the character with the highest result wins. Equal results tie unless this provides no clear result, in which case the winner is the character with the highest skill bonus. If this still ties, a random die roll determines the winner.</p><h2>COOPERATIVE CHECKS</h2><p>When multiple characters work together to perform a task, they make a “cooperative check.” One character becomes the leader and all others become helpers. A maximum of 5 helpers may assist each skill check. The leader makes a standard skill check against the full DC and then each helper makes the same check against a DC of 15. For each helper who succeeds, the leader’s result increases by 1, and for each helper who scores a critical success the leader’s result increases by 2. If any of the helpers suffers a critical failure, however, the entire task is ruined and must be started again. The leader’s total result — after all helper bonuses are applied — determines the cooperative check’s outcome.</p><h2>TEAM CHECKS</h2><p>Sometimes several characters perform a single task together and individual success is irrelevant — when Bluffing, for example, even one failure can expose everyone involved. Other times several characters making the same check, or even a cooperative check, unfairly tips the odds in the characters’ favor (even a few characters can practically ensure success with Notice or Search, for instance). In either of these cases the group should make a “team check.” This works like a standard skill check, except that only one character makes the check for the entire team.</p><p>• If every member of the team must succeed to reap the benefit (e.g. the Bluff), the character with the lowest skill bonus makes the check.</p><p>• If only one character must succeed for the entire team to reap the benefit (e.g. the patrol), the character with the highest skill bonus makes the check.</p><p>When two or more characters qualify, the team chooses which makes the check.</p><h2>KNOWLEDGE CHECKS</h2><p>Character knowledge differs from player knowledge and what a character knows can often mean the difference between victory and defeat, or life and death. When a character’s knowledge is in question he makes a “Knowledge check.” The player rolls 1d20 and adds his Int modifier + the total number of Studies he knows (see page 61). He has the knowledge in question if his result beats the DC listed on Table 2.2: Knowledge Checks (see page 67).</p><p>When the character possesses 4 or more ranks in a related skill, he may ask for a synergy bonus, though the GM may refuse if he feels the skill isn’t directly relevant. When a Knowledge check result logically translates to an in-game benefit (e.g. realizing details about an opponent’s fighting style during a fight), treat the information like a related Study.</p><h4>Table 2.2: Knowledge Checks</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Obscurity</th><th style=\"width:40px\">DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Common (e.g. laws in local area, info about brigands and monsters seen often on local roads)</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Uncommon (e.g. laws in neighboring areas, info about brigands and monsters seen occasionally on local roads)</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Rare (e.g. laws in distant lands, info about brigands and monsters that keep away from civilized areas)</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Obscure (e.g. laws of uncommon brigands and monsters and info about their leaders)</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Presumed Lost (e.g. laws of ancient gods, info about unique creatures of myth and legend)</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>COMPLEX TASKS</h2><p>It can often help the flow and drama of the game to break a task into smaller steps, each a separate skill check. This prolongs the action and sustains tension over multiple die rolls, and also keeps any single roll from ending the fun in what should be a complex encounter. When skill checks are grouped together like this they’re called “Complex Tasks.”</p><p>Crawling inside a huge clockwork monster to disable it from within is an excellent example of a Complex Task, with steps including Acrobatics (to get inside), Search (to find the critical bits of machinery), and Prestidigitation (to disable each in turn). Another great example is rifling through stacks of scrolls and journals in a trapped tomb, looking for the way out before poison gas floods the chamber. In this second case Investigate might be used repeatedly — not to determine success but whether the team finds the answer in time.</p><p>A Complex Task consists of 2 or more Challenges, each a step in the process and a skill check that must succeed for the task to continue. The GM may make all of a task’s Challenges clear at the start or he might keep each secret until it’s reached. Each Challenge attempt takes a certain amount of time, which may or may not match the time required for any listed check using the skill. Complex Tasks can also have a time limit, like the previously mentioned tomb search, which makes every check all that much more vital to ultimate victory.</p><p>Each successful skill check clears the current Challenge and moves the action to the next. Each failure yields no progress and increases the current Challenge’s error range by 2 (as the pressure mounts and the seeds of doubt take hold). A critical success, or breakthrough, clears 2 Challenges instead of 1, while a critical failure, or setback, rolls the action back by 1 Challenge per action die spent.</p><p>Success with the last Challenge completes the task. Conversely, the task fails if a critical failure drops the number of cleared Challenges below 0 or if a time limit runs out before the last Challenge is completed.</p><p>Complex Tasks are a powerful cinematic tool but they work best when lavished with detail unique to the situation. Describing each step, breakthrough, and setback independently of the others — even when they’re conceptually and mechanically identical — offers a frame of reference for what the characters are doing and invests the players more heavily in the event. It also keeps them from getting bored. Story-critical Complex Tasks can also be prepped as part of the adventure, giving the GM plenty of time to make them as interesting as possible. However, when they crop up in play improvisation is the watchword of the day — everyone, GM and players alike, should have the chance to get involved (<em>for more guidance, see page 338</em>).</p><h2>DOWNTIME</h2><p>In games that take place over long periods (such as full campaigns), the characters often spend a good deal of time not adventuring. They visit towns and cities between forays into local dungeons. They travel on ships and in caravans for weeks at a time. Eventually, they may even enjoy a well-earned vacation at home. In Fantasy Craft, these periods are called “Downtime.”</p><p>Downtime offers a fair and quick way for the characters to accomplish things in periods that typically happen “off screen” without the need for complex bookkeeping that might otherwise throw off the momentum of the game. It also allows for fully open ended play, where adventures overlap with intermittent breaks or the characters drive the plot instead of responding to it.</p><p>Downtime can happen whenever at least several hours pass without obvious story development or challenge for the characters. Only the GM may declare Downtime and when he does he must also declare a window of time the characters can fill with Downtime activities. The declared window may not be the actual window the GM has planned — surprise events may shorten or lengthen it — but it’s the period the characters expect to be free. For instance, a party helping to defend a fortress may receive word that the enemy isn’t expected for a full week and plan accordingly, only to find hostile forces amassing outside five days later. The expected Downtime of 1 week shortens to 5 days and less is accomplished as a result.</p><p>Downtime exists outside the typical flow of an adventure. During this period, characters may not use abilities or other character options with a limited number of uses per scene, adventure, or session. Likewise, unless Downtime marks a break between adventures or scenes, these abilities and options do not refresh, nor do action dice.</p><h2>DOWNTIME CHECKS</h2><p>Each character may only productively pursue one activity (make one skill check) during each period of Downtime, no matter how long the period is. Multiple characters may jointly undertake the same activity (make a cooperative check), but this does not allow them to split their attention (make more than one skill check as a group). This limit is arbitrary but practical; though characters live rich, full lives at all times, Downtime doesn’t simulate every personal project. Rather, it focuses on the one major activity highlighting each span of loose time, like a montage in a fantasy movie or a brief paragraph in an adventure novel.</p><p>Fantasy Craft features several Downtime checks, though the GM may introduce more. Most of these are handled with specific skills: Crafting, Medicine, Resolve, and Survival (<em>see their individual skill descriptions for details</em>). Two additional checks allow characters to earn money or Reputation with any plausible skill — though the GM may always decline, preferably with a good reason supported by or expanding the story. For example, a character might be able to use Acrobatics to make some silver as a street performer in one town, only to find that another town’s standoffish citizens or draconian laws make it impossible. A high Ride skill might win over a local noble with a fondness for horses, yielding Reputation for the character — unless a recent outbreak of disease decimated the local herd. As usual, the GM should always strive to be fair in ruling what skills may be used to generate money or Reputation, but at the same time he should try to keep the game interesting, diverse, and challenging for everyone.</p><p>When a character uses a skill to make money or Reputation, he makes one of two checks.</p><p>• <em>Earn Income:</em> Before rolling the character names one activity he’s performing to earn money, which must be supported by one skill he intends to use. The GM may deny the check based on local opportunity, in which case the player or GM may discuss alternatives. This check has no DC; instead, the character’s result is cross-referenced with the available Downtime on Table 2.3: Earning Income and Reputation (see page 69). A critical success yields an additional 50% (rounded up) and a critical failure yields 50% less (rounded down). The character’s Prudence is immediately applied to the money earned (see page 153).</p><p>• <em>Foster Good Will:</em> Before rolling the character names one activity he’s performing to earn Reputation, which must be supported by one skill he intends to use. The GM may deny the check based on local opportunity, in which case the player or GM may discuss alternatives. This check has no DC; instead, the character’s result is cross-referenced with the available Downtime on Table 2.3: Earning Income and Reputation. A critical success yields an additional 50% (rounded up) and a critical failure yields 50% less (rounded down).</p><p>A character may not take 10 or 20 with either of these checks. Also, he may not spend action dice to boost his result. contacts and assistants may become helpers when these checks are made cooperatively but they may not become leaders.</p><h4>Table 2.3: Earning Income and Reputation</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Result</th><th>Per Day</th><th>Per Week</th><th>Per Month</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Up to 15</td><td>1s/—</td><td>10s/0</td><td>50s/0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">16–25</td><td>3s/—</td><td>30s/0</td><td>150s/1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">26–35</td><td>6s/—</td><td>60s/1</td><td>300s/2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">36–45</td><td>10s/—</td><td>100s/1</td><td>500s/3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">46+</td><td>15s/—</td><td>150s/1</td><td>750s/4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Money earned is to the left of the slash and Reputation earned is to the right. Multiply the amount listed by the number of days, weeks, or months spent making the check. A character may earn one or the other during each Downtime, not both.</p><h2>DOWNTIME TRAVEL</h2><p>Lengthy travel frequently takes place during Downtime, letting the GM and players dedicate as much or as little attention to the journey as desired. Speed, encounters, and other facets of travel are found in Chapter 7 (see page 371), and with GM permission a relatively calm trip may allow for a Downtime check.</p><h2>SKILL DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p>Each skill’s most common key attribute is listed in parentheses next to its name. Suggested Knowledge checks follow a general overview, along with any other information pertinent to all the skill’s uses. Individual checks and their required times round out the presentation.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":2450000,"name":"FEATS","type":"text","_id":"7k5F6xFWvnQD06uR","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Feats let you customize your character, granting special abilities or bonuses to existing abilities. Characters may gain feats from 3 sources.</p><p>• Specialty grants 1 feat (see page 21).</p><p>• Career Level grants several feats (see page 27).</p><p>• Class sometimes grants either a choice of feats or a specific feat.</p><h2>PREREQUISITES</h2><p>When a character gains his choice of feats (generally from level or a class), he must meet all of a feat’s prerequisites before he can take it. Many feats have other, often less powerful feats as prerequisites, ensuring that characters gain access to more advanced abilities as they specialize.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil is interested in the Rage Supremacy feat. He must acquire both Rage Basics and then Rage Mastery before he may take the Rage Supremacy feat.</p><p>When a character gains a specific feat, that feat’s prerequisites are waived. If the character already has the feat, he instead chooses 1 feat from the same feat tree as described above.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Tanan has the Armor Basics feat (a Basic Combat feat). When he gains Level 2 of the Lancer class, it grants him the Armor Basics feat again. He gets to choose another Basic Combat feat but must meet the prerequisites of any feat he chooses.</p><p>If a character loses one or more prerequisites for a feat — due to attribute penalties, for example — he keeps the feat but may not benefit from it or use its abilities until he regains all of its prerequisites.</p><h2>RESTRICTED AND TEMPORARY FEATS</h2><p>Sometimes feats come with a catch.</p><h3>RESTRICTED FEATS</h3><p>Sometimes a feat suffers from specific limitations (e.g. a feat’s abilities may only apply to attacks with a specific weapon, or to skill checks with a specific item). Such a feat is “restricted” and while it may be used to meet the prerequisites of other feats any limitations that apply to it also apply to each feat for which it’s a prerequisite. Also, a restricted feat may never be used to meet expert class requirements.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Gholin gains the fell hand ability from his Priest class, which grants him the benefits of the All Out Attack andCleave Basics feats when using his ritual weapon (a war hammer). Gholin later uses this Cleave Basics feat to gain Cleave Mastery but he may only use Cleave Mastery with his war hammer.</p><h3>TEMPORARY FEATS</h3><p>A temporary feat only lasts for a limited period of time. A character must meet all prerequisites for a temporary feat before he may take it, and he can’t gain any temporary feat with the same name as a feat he already has. </p><p>Temporary feats may be used to meet the prerequisites of other temporary feats but may never be used to meet the prerequisites for any permanent feat, or to meet expert class requirements.</p><h3>EDGE</h3><p>Special characters sometimes build momentum, called Edge, and can use it to pull off amazing results that standard characters can only look upon with awe. Each special character may accumulate up to 5 Edge at one time and all Edge is lost at the end of each combat. Edge may be spent to use certain exclusive tricks, actions, and abilities.</p><h2>FEAT TREES</h2><p>Fantasy Craft groups feats into categories called ‘trees.’ Each tree includes a range of feats relating to one area of heroic expertise.</p><p><strong>Basic Combat Feats (pages 85–87):</strong> Focus on combat fundamentals and tactics</p><p><strong>Melee Combat Feats (pages 87–91):</strong> Focus on melee weapons</p><p><strong>Ranged Combat Feats (page 92):</strong> Focus on ranged weapons</p><p><strong>Unarmed Combat Feats (pages 93–94):</strong> Focus on martial arts and natural attacks</p><p><strong>Chance Feats (page 94–95):</strong> Focus on extraordinary luck — good for you and bad for others</p><p><strong>Covert Feats (pages 95–96):</strong> Focus on stealth, evasion, and subterfuge</p><p><strong>Gear Feats (pages 96–99):</strong> Focus on equipment</p><p><strong>Skill Feats (pages 99):</strong> Focus on skill use and character advancement</p><p><strong>Species Feats (pages 99–105):</strong> Focus on heritage and unusual racial abilities</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Feats (pages 105–107):</strong> Focus on spell use</p><p><strong>Style Feats (pages 107–108):</strong> Focus on savoir-faire and social interaction</p><p><strong>Terrain Feats (pages 108–109):</strong> Focus on using the environment to your advantage</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.A5AWcedGRArQruMS.JournalEntryPage.7k5F6xFWvnQD06uR"}}},{"sort":2550000,"name":"FEAT DESCRIPTIONS","type":"text","_id":"9e57z5Z9VawOd9Ol","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>After its title and flavor summary, a feat description includes some or all of these entries.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You must meet these requirements before you can take the feat.</p><p><em>• Level 1 only:</em> The feat may only be gained during character creation (at Career Level 1).

{"name":"Chapter 3: Grimoire","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"GRIMOIRE","type":"text","_id":"ciSoWbegsQyBrHdM","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Magic exists just below the skin of the world, a primal force waiting to be harnessed. Some characters are “casters,” able to tap this force to create a wide variety of effects called “spells.” Casters fall into two categories.</p><h2>ARCANE CASTERS</h2><p>Arcane casters appear in campaigns with the sorcery quality (see page 325). Through study and ritual, they learn to direct magic by will alone, choosing their spells and casting them with precision. They’re flexible and versatile but also fallible, squandering precious power when they lose control.</p><p><strong>Known Spells:</strong> When an arcane caster gains his first Casting Level he immediately learns a number of spells of any level equal to his Wisdom score + his Spellcasting ranks. Depending on the nature of magic in the setting (see page 314), these spells may be chosen or randomly rolled on Table 3.2: Spells (see page 114). Once learned, spells may not be exchanged.</p><p>When a caster’s Wisdom or Spellcasting ranks permanently increase, he learns an equal number of spells.</p><p>The method in which spells are gained is left intentionally undefined so it may be fit the needs of the setting. It may involve research, training, or spells may simply “come to” casters.</p><p>Knowing a spell does not automatically convey the ability to cast it — the limits of arcane spellcasting are set by class.</p><p><strong>Losing and Regaining Known Spells:</strong> Should an arcane caster’s known spells decrease — temporarily or permanently — he chooses which spells are lost. Should this number later increase again the caster must relearn the lost spells before he can gain new ones. Lost spells may be relearned in any order.</p><p><strong>Spell Points:</strong> An arcane caster invokes spells by spending spell points, which he gains from a number of sources (primarily class). He pays spell points equal to a spell’s level each time he tries to cast it (and doesn’t regain them even if his Spellcasting check fails). Spell points are fully recovered at the start of each scene with one exception: if any of the caster’s spells with a Duration other than Permanent are still in effect from a previous scene, those spell points are not recovered, even if the spell’s Duration ends during the current scene.</p><h2>DIVINE CASTERS</h2><p>Priests and other divine casters appear in campaign with the miracles quality (see page 324). They serve as conduits of great forces or divine will, walking pre-set devotional Paths that grant them a variety of magic effects, including a small number of reliable spells they can cast without fail.</p><p><strong>Alignment and Paths:</strong> The Paths a divine caster may walk are dictated by his god, ethos, or beliefs (i.e. his Alignment). Steps are taken in order along each Path and each Step grants specific abilities that may or may not include spells (see page 310). These abilities may not be exchanged.</p><p>When a divine caster invokes a spell granted by a Path, he does not make a Spellcasting check; rather, the spell is automatically cast, as if he’d rolled a Spellcasting result exactly equal to the DC required to cast the spell. When a divine caster invokes an attack spell, the spell is cast as if he’d rolled a Spellcasting result equal to the target’s Defense or the Spellcasting DC, whichever is higher (see Table 3.1: Spellcasting, page 112).</p><p>When invoking a spell gained from a Path, a divine caster may apply a single Spellcasting trick without paying spell points, but he must still take the Casting Time and pay the spell’s Preparation Cost (if any).</p><p><strong>Losing and Regaining Alignment and Steps:</strong> Should a divine caster lose or change his Alignment or Steps along a Path — temporarily or permanently — he loses all associated abilities and spells. Regaining the Alignment or Steps restores these abilities and spells (see Crisis of Faith, page 381).</p><p><strong>Spell Points:</strong> A divine caster doesn’t gain spell points and doesn’t need them to cast spells; instead, spell abilities granted by Paths are generally limited to 1 use per scene (see page 310).</p><h1>THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC</h1><p>Spells are grouped into 8 Schools, each consisting of 3 Disciplines. Each School represents an iconic approach to magic seen in myth, folklore, and fiction, while each Discipline focuses on a set of related effects and activities. Each spell is part of only 1 Discipline.</p><p>For an even more robust experience, check out Spellbound, available soon in print and PDF.</p><p><strong>Channeler:</strong> This highly combative School taps and controls primal forces.<br /><em>• Energy:</em> Creates surges of fire, light, and sound, mostly in the form of powerful destructive spells<br /><em>• Force:</em> Generates invisible mass the caster can shape and direct at will<br /><em>• Weather:</em> Manipulates the environment, particularly the atmosphere</p><p><strong>Conjuror:</strong> This School makes and controls the building blocks of the physical world.<br /><em>• Compass:</em> Alters time, speed, position, and size<br /><em>• Conversion:</em> Changes the shape and properties of matter <br /><em>• Creation:</em> Creates matter from nothing</p><p><strong>Enchanter:</strong> This intimate School grants dominion over life in all its myriad forms.<br /><em>• Charm:</em> Influences the minds and emotions of others<br /><em>• Healing:</em> Repairs and refreshes the body and mind<br /><em>• Nature:</em> Sways plants and animals</p><p><strong>Preserver:</strong> This School focuses on protecting and liberating places and people.<br /><em>• Glory:</em> Invokes righteous fury, promoting excellence and victory in battle<br /><em>• Seals:</em> Forms magical glyphs and impediments<br /><em>• Warding:</em> Prevents and deflects harm</p><p><strong>Prophet:</strong> This School teaches about the worlds beyond ours, as well as what ours might become.<br /><em>• Blessing:</em> Reveals cosmic splendor, raising the body, mind, and spirit<br /><em>• Calling:</em> Channels and summons from the fringes of this world, and beyond<br /><em>• Foresight:</em> Predicts and manifests the future</p><p><strong>Reaper:</strong> Rooted in suffering and death, this School promotes pain, fear, and corruption.<br /><em>• Affliction:</em> Brings lasting suffering, commonly as curses<br /><em>• Necromancy:</em> Explores the veil between death and undeath <br /><em>• Shadow:</em> Harnesses the power of darkness</p><p><strong>Seer:</strong> This School offers unique insights about the mechanics of the known world.<br /><em>• Artifice:</em> Exposes and transforms the inner workings of machines, magic items, and spells<br /><em>• Divination:</em> Gleans details about the past and present<br /><em>• Word:</em> Derives power from language</p><p><strong>Trickster:</strong> This School makes truth of untruth.<br /><em>• Illusion</em>: Projects false images and feelings<br /><em>• Secrets:</em> Invents lies and reveals truths<br /><em>• Shapeshifting:</em> Transforms the body</p><h1>SPELLCASTING (INT)</h1><p>Mages and other arcane casters can spend skill points to purchase ranks in the Spellcasting skill, which is only available to characters with a Casting Level of 1 or higher. Spellcasting operates like any other skill.</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> A caster without a mage’s pouch is considered untrained even when he has Spellcasting ranks (see page 63). With access to a mage’s workshop, a caster’s threat range increases by 3.</p><p><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Magic Schools and Disciplines; casting techniques; spell components</p><h2>SPELLCASTING (VARIES)</h2><p>An arcane caster makes this check to cast spells he knows and may use (it’s possible for a caster to learn spells without having the ability to use them). Each caster may make only 1 Spellcasting check per round and he must be able to speak aloud to do so. Spellcasting is an obvious action and clearly visible to anyone with line of sight to the caster; to conceal an attempt, the caster must also make a Prestidigitation check opposed by Notice.</p><p>To make a Spellcasting check, the caster spends spell points equal to the desired spell’s level + any additional points required for tricks and other effects. He takes the spell’s Casting Time and compares his result to the DC listed on Table 3.1: Spellcasting Checks (see below). With success, the spell is cast and its effect occurs. With failure, the spell is not cast and has no effect (a sentient target feels a hostile force or tingle but cannot deduce the nature or origin of the sensation).</p><p>With a critical success, the caster regains the spell points spent to cast the spell. With a critical failure, his confidence is shaken and he suffers a –5 penalty with Spellcasting checks until he succeeds with a Spellcasting check or until the end of the current scene, whichever comes first.</p><h4>Table 3.1: Spellcasting Checks</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Spell Level</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">0</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">2</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">4</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">5</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">6</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">7</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">8</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">9</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>ATTACK SPELLS</h2><p>When a spell is used to attack, either as part of the spell description (e.g. “long range attack”) or due to the situation (e.g. the target tries to avoid a “touch” spell), the Spellcasting result is also the attack result. Spell attacks that inflict damage share the Spellcasting check’s threat range. With a critical success, the caster may choose to either regain the spell points spent to cast the spell or cause the spell to inflict a critical hit on the original target — not both.</p><p>Ranged spell attacks deviate from the first target with a miss (see page 214). For this purpose each range increment is equal to 1/10 the spell’s maximum range (rounded up).</p><h2>SPELL DEFENSE</h2><p>Certain characters and objects possess Spell Defense, which makes it more difficult to target them with spells. When a target has Spell Defense, the Spellcasting result must also equal or exceed the Spell Defense or the spell fails.</p><h2>COUNTERED AND SUPPRESSED SPELLS</h2><p>Various effects can counter or suppress spells.</p><p>• A <em>countered</em> spell’s effect and Duration end. If this occurs during the Spellcasting check, the spell is still considered to have been cast but its effect and Duration end before they begin.</p><p>• A <em>suppressed</em> spell’s effect pauses but its Duration continues. The effect resumes if any Duration remains when the suppression ends.</p><h1>SPELL DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p>Each spell description has some or all of these entries.</p><h2>LEVEL</h2><p>A spell’s level ranges from 0 to 9 and defines its relative power. The spell’s Discipline follows its level, as may one or more of these terms.</p><p><strong>Air:</strong> This spell cannot be cast underwater or in a vacuum.</p><p><strong>Aligned:</strong> The caster must possess an Alignment to cast this spell and the spell gains the caster’s Alignment when it’s cast. Depending on the nature of Alignment in the setting, the spell may oppose one or more other Alignments (see page 309).</p><p><strong>Curse:</strong> This spell cannot be countered or suppressed. It may only be removed with a Lift Curse spell (see page 135).</p><p><strong>Darkness (opposes Light):</strong> When a damaging Darkness spell targets an undead character, that character instead heals the same amount. Also, magic darkness blocks darkvision.</p><p><strong>Earth:</strong> This spell cannot be cast in mid-air.</p><p><strong>Fire:</strong> This spell cannot be cast underwater. Also, any effect or item generated by the spell is suppressed when submerged.</p><p><strong>Ice:</strong> When this spell’s effect happens underwater, an ice block forms across the Area with a Damage save bonus equal to the caster’s Casting Level + the Spell Level. Any character caught in this area becomes pinned in the ice block (Athletics check DC 20 to escape).</p><p><strong>Light (opposes Darkness):</strong> When a healing Light spell targets an undead character, that character instead suffers the same amount of damage.</p><p><strong>Lightning:</strong> When this spell’s effect happens underwater, the Distance becomes Personal and the Area becomes an explosive sphere with a blast increment of 2 squares. Everyone in the Area suffers the effect, including the caster.</p><p><strong>Silence (opposes Sonic)</strong></p><p><strong>Sonic (opposes Silence):</strong> This spell may not be cast in a vacuum.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> This spell cannot be cast in mid-air.</p><p>When two opposing spells occupy the same Area, the spell with the lower Casting Level + Spell Level is countered. When these values are equal, both spells are countered.</p><h2>CASTING TIME</h2><p>Most spells have a Casting Time of 1 free, 1 half, or 1 full action. With a longer Casting Time, the effect happens at the start of the caster’s first Initiative Count after the casting is complete.</p><p>In all cases, the caster makes the Spellcasting check at the moment casting is complete and chooses targets, Area, effect, and other facts of the spell at that time.</p><h2>DISTANCE</h2><p>This is the maximum distance at which the effect may be placed.</p><p><strong>Personal:</strong> The effect happens at the caster.</p><p><strong>Touch:</strong> The effect happens at a character, object, or piece of scenery the caster touches. Unless the Distance is also Personal, the caster may not place the effect on himself.</p><p><strong>Close:</strong> The effect may happen at any distance up to 50 ft. from the caster.</p><p><strong>Local:</strong> The effect may happen at any distance up to 250 ft. from the caster.</p><p><strong>Remote:</strong> The effect may happen at any distance up to 1,000 ft. from the caster.</p><p><strong>Unlimited:</strong> The effect may happen anywhere in the caster’s current setting (per the GM).</p><p><strong>Short Range:</strong> The effect travels from the caster up to 50 ft. away.</p><p><strong>Medium Range:</strong> The effect travels from the caster up to 250 ft. away.</p><p><strong>Long Range:</strong> The effect travels from the caster up to 1,000 ft. away.</p><h2>AREA</h2><p>When a spell’s Area is larger than 1 character or object, it’s centered on 1 square and consists of a size and shape (e.g. “20 ft. sphere” or “15 ft. cube”). The size is always in feet and represents volume, distance, or radius as noted in the spell description. The caster may decrease a spell’s size during casting but not after.</p><p><strong>Caster-Defined:</strong> The spell’s Area may take any shape, so long as each square is adjacent to at least 1 other square (e.g. if the size is 40 ft. the caster may choose any 8 connected squares).</p><p><strong>Cone:</strong> The spell’s Area is a quarter-circle pointed away from the caster in a direction of his choice (see page 214).</p><p><strong>Cube:</strong> The spell’s Area is a square around the target.</p><p><strong>Line:</strong> The spell’s Area is a straight line from the target square in a direction of the caster’s choice.</p><p><strong>Penetrating:</strong> The spell affects targets even through cover (up to Damage save +20).</p><p><strong>Pillar:</strong> The spell’s Area is a vertical pillar whose bottom is a circular shape centered on the target.</p><p><strong>Sphere:</strong> The spell’s Area is a sphere around the target (see page 214).</p><p><strong>Wall:</strong> The spell’s Area is a barrier through a row of squares. It may wind and curve as the caster likes.</p><h2>DURATION</h2><p>Most spells have a fixed Duration measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or other common increments, though there are a few exceptions.</p><p><strong>Instant:</strong> The effect happens and winks out in a fraction of an instant.</p><p><strong>Permanent:</strong> The effect lingers until the spell is countered.</p><p><strong>Concentration:</strong> The effect lasts as long as the caster concentrates (taking no other actions).</p><p><strong>Concentration, up to Duration:</strong> The effect lasts as long as the caster concentrates, up to the listed Duration.</p><p><strong>Concentration + Duration:</strong> The effect lasts as long as the caster concentrates and for a Duration thereafter.</p><p><strong>Dismissible:</strong> The effect lasts for a Duration or until the caster voluntarily wills it to end (as a free action). A dismissible effect immediately ends when the caster is killed.</p><p><strong>Enduring:</strong> A Permanency spell may be cast on the effect.</p><p><strong>Variable Duration:</strong> The effect lasts a random amount of time (e.g. “1d4 hours”). The GM rolls the Duration secretly so the caster doesn’t know how long the spell will last.</p><h2>SAVING THROW</h2><p>When a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect, the saving throw DC is 10 + the caster’s Charisma modifier + the caster’s number of Spellcasting feats. Any target may willingly accept a spell’s effect, making no saving throw.</p><p>Unattended objects cannot make saving throws and are automatically affected by spells cast on them. Carried objects suffer the same effects as characters holding or wearing them.</p><p><strong>Disbelief:</strong> The character may instead make a Sense Motive (Wis) check to save against the effect.</p><p><strong>Negates:</strong> With success, the spell has no effect.</p><p><strong>Negates Scene:</strong> With success, the spell has no effect and the target is immune to the spell for the rest of the scene.</p><p><strong>Partial:</strong> With success, the effect is lessened as described.</p><p><strong>Half:</strong> With success, the effect drops to 1/2 (rounded down).</p><p><strong>Harmless:</strong> The spell is usually beneficial but a target may attempt a saving throw if he likes.</p><p><strong>Repeatable:</strong> With failure, the target may spend 1 half action during each subsequent round to try again.</p><p><strong>Terminal:</strong> The effect is catastrophic and frequently game ending. In the interest of fairness, special characters gain a +4 bonus with their save.

The cloud may be stationary or move 10 ft. away from you each round (choose when the spell is cast). Its vapors are heavier than air and sink, even pouring down through openings. The cloud can’t penetrate liquids. Wind disperses it in 4 rounds and a tornado disperses it immediately.

With GM approval, you may modify your choice, choose an elemental from the Bestiary (see page 253), or build a new NPC, so long as it has the Elemental Type and a maximum XP value of 40. The appearance of this servant should match your style of magic. At the GM’s discretion, it could take the form of any species, though this choice has no effect on the NPC’s stats. The NPC is always composed entirely of the spell’s element. A summoned character cannot summon other characters and is banished when killed or when the spell that summoned it ends (whichever comes first). Certain spells and other effects can banish a summoned character earlier. A banished character’s body and possessions dissolve in 1d4 rounds. The elemental may not act during the round it appears. Thereafter it follows your commands to the best of its ability. In the absence of instructions the elemental falls under the GM’s control, though it continues to serve you as best it perceives it can (e.g. attacks whatever seems to be your enemy, brings you things it thinks will help you, etc.). <br /><strong>Air Elemental I (Small Elemental Flyer — 36 XP): </strong>Str 10, Dex 12, Con 10, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 10;

The spell ends early if the character makes a successful 1-minute Knowledge check (DC 15 + your Casting Level), or if the character is targeted with a successful spell that transfers him back to this world. At the character’s return, he appears at his previous location, or in the nearest unoccupied square.</p><h4>MOVE EARTH</h4><p><strong>Level: </strong>5 Conversion (Earth) <br /><strong>Casting Time: </strong>1 full action <br /><strong>Distance: </strong>Remote <br /><strong>Duration: </strong>Permanent <br /><strong>Effect: </strong>For every 10 minutes you concentrate (to a maximum of 1 hour), you reshape a different flat patch of soil (e.g. clay, dirt, loam, or sand). Each patch may be up to your Casting Level × 10 ft. on a side and up to 10 ft. deep. The reshaping forms wavelike crests and troughs but has no impact on stone and can’t dramatically reform the land. Trees, buildings, rock formations, and other solid landmarks are unaffected outside elevation and relative topography. You cannot use this spell to tunnel and it’s too slow to trap or bury others. Its primary uses are digging moats, reshaping rivers, and adjusting terrain contours before a battle (collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and the like).</p><h4>MOVE WATER</h4><p><strong>Level: </strong>4 Conversion (Water) <br /><strong>Casting Time: </strong>1 full action <br /><strong>Distance: </strong>Remote <br /><strong>Duration: </strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour <br /><strong>Effect: </strong>You reshape or redirect a cubic volume of liquid up your Casting Level × 10 ft. on a side and may hold it in any shape, even against gravity.

You disappear when inside the corridor, reappearing when you exit. The corridor is likewise invisible and may overlap with solid matter, allowing you to move freely through walls, hills, and other obstacles. Any number of other characters may enter or pass through the corridor but only with your permission. You can also set a word, phrase, or action to allow entry when you’re not present.</p><h4>SHAPE STONE</h4><p><strong>Level: </strong>3 Conversion (Earth) <br /><strong>Casting Time: </strong>1 half action <br /><strong>Distance: </strong>Touch <br /><strong>Duration: </strong>Instant <br /><strong>Effect: </strong>You reshape an existing piece of stone up to 10 cubic ft. + 1 cubic ft. per Casting Level.

You must have visited the destination before and characters may not be overloaded. All characters must be in physical contact with each other and at least 1 of them must be in physical contact with you. Teleportation is not an exact science; unless you succeed with a Survival check (DC 20 with a synergy bonus from Spellcasting), you wind up a number of miles equal to the difference in a random direction, per the Deviation rules (see, page 214).</p><h4>TELEPORT II</h4><p><strong>Level: </strong>7 Compass <br /><strong>Effect: </strong>As Teleport I, except you may transport yourself and companions across any distance. You need not have visited the destination before but you must have a reliable description of it. Also, the Survival check DC drops to 15.</p><h4>TIME STOP</h4><p><strong>Level: </strong>9 Compass <br /><strong>Casting Time: </strong>1 half action <br /><strong>Distance: </strong>Personal <br /><strong>Duration: </strong>Instant <br /><strong>Preparation Cost: </strong>10 <br /><strong>Effect: </strong>Time speeds up for you, making it appear that others are frozen around you. You are free to act for 1d6 rounds of your time, though you can’t target other characters with attacks or spells, nor may you move or harm them or anything they carry. Harmful spells that last after Time Stop ends affect others as normal. Fire, heat, cold, gas, and other persistent sources of damage affect you during each of your rounds as normal.</p><h4>WALL OF STONE</h4><p><strong>Level: </strong>5 Creation (Earth) <br /><strong>Casting Time: </strong>1 half action <br /><strong>Distance: </strong>Local <br /><strong>Area: </strong>20 ft. long per Casting Level wall, 20 ft. tall, 1 ft. thick <br /><strong>Duration: </strong>Concentration + 1 round per Casting Level (dismissible, enduring) <br /><strong>Saving Throw: </strong>Reflex partial (new position) <br /><strong>Effect: </strong>A curtain of rock rises from the ground, pushing characters and objects into adjacent squares (with a successful Reflex save, a character may wind up on top or on the side of his choice; otherwise, you choose his new location). The curtain can be crudely shaped to produce crenellations along its upper edge, granting 1/4 cover to any kneeling behind. Characters cannot be attacked through the curtain. It has DR 5 and if it suffers 20 damage a single-square hole is punched through, reforming in 10 minutes.</p><h4>WATER WALK</h4><p><strong>Level: </strong>0 Compass (Water) <br /><strong>Casting Time: </strong>1 half action <br /><strong>Distance: </strong>Personal or Touch <br /><strong>Duration: </strong>1 minute per Casting Level <br /><strong>Effect: </strong>One character can tread on fluid as if walking on solid ground.

The servant’s nature should match your magic style. It could be a religious icon sent to aid you, an otherworldly being bound by an ancient pact, or something else entirely. A summoned character cannot summon other characters and is banished when killed or when the spell that summoned it ends (whichever comes first). Certain spells and other effects can banish a summoned character earlier. A banished character’s body and possessions dissolve in 1d4 rounds. The outsider may not act during the round it appears. Thereafter it follows your commands to the best of its ability. In the absence of instructions it falls under the GM’s control, though it continues to serve you as best it perceives it can (e.g. advisors offer wisdom, brawlers attack whatever seems to be your enemy, servitors bring you things they think will help you, etc.).</p><p><strong>Advisor I (Medium Outsider Flyer/Walker — 36 XP):</strong> Str 12, Dex 10, Con 10, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 10;

His lifestyle improves as well, as his means allow for finer garments, more prestigious accessories, and larger holdings with better facilities. Perhaps most importantly of all, he earns a name for himself, renown he can barter for favors and other perks beyond the value of gold. Because in the end, a hero is worth more than what he owns — for good or ill, he’s measured just as much by his deeds and legacy.</p><p>This chapter focuses on equipment, magic items, reputation, and related rules. Here you’ll learn how to outfit for adventure and what you can expect from the spoils of victory. It all starts with the cornerstones of the Fantasy Craft gear system: Coin and Lifestyle.</p><h1>COIN</h1><p>The first measure of your riches is the coin you own. The basic monetary unit in Fantasy Craft is the silver piece (often abbreviated as ‘s’ after the number of coins). All gear prices are listed in silver pieces and other coins and trade goods (such as gems, precious metal ingots, rare spices and commodities) are valued in silver as well. Your setting might substitute another base unit, such as steel in a world where it’s a rare metal, or rice koku in feudal Japan, in which case everything should scale against the new base unit (with potential adjustments based on supply and demand). More information is available in the World Building section of Chapter 7 (see page 317).</p><p>Coin (or the local equivalent) is used to purchase gear, services, and conduct day-to-day business in civilized parts of the world. It’s often a reward for taking on heroic tasks and can be found on defeated bandits, monsters, and other enemies. Your supply of coin will rise and fall throughout your career and there’s no “right” amount to have at any point in play. Still, most heroes tend to go through money like water, the lure of coin putting them squarely on the path to adventure.</p><p>Coin is divided into 2 categories, each recorded separately on your character sheet.</p><p><em>• Coin in Hand:</em> This includes all the money you’ve acquired in the current adventure. You can spend coin in hand freely.</p><p><em>• Stake:</em> This consists of all the money you’ve put away over time for major purchases and times of need. You may only pull money from your stake while in a city or visiting your home.</p><p>At the end of each adventure you can transfer a certain amount of your coin in hand into your stake. The rest is automatically spent during Downtime, frittered away on pleasures and covering expenses not expressly taken into account by the rules (e.g. day to day living, entertainment, personal debts, and the like). The amount you can transfer into your stake after each adventure is determined by your Prudence (see below).</p><h2>GETTING STARTED</h2><p>A new character starts with a stake of 100 silver × his Career Level.</p><h1>LIFESTYLE</h1><p>The second measure of your riches is Lifestyle, which determines both your general style and your knack for handling money. Lifestyle is a score divided between Panache and Prudence. Each time your Lifestyle rises by 1 you may invest that point in either of these two (but not both), choosing whether to live it up or plan for the future. Likewise, each time your Lifestyle falls by 1 you must also reduce your Panache or Prudence by 1. You gain Lifestyle from your class and may gain bonuses from certain character options, including Origin and feats.</p><h2>PANACHE</h2><p>Your Panache score summarizes your ability to present yourself with flair and elegance. As your Panache increases, you gain a growing Appearance bonus and modest sums of spending money.</p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Each time you make a Charisma-based skill check targeting another character, you gain a +1 bonus with your check per point that your Appearance bonus exceeds the target’s Appearance bonus. Your Appearance bonus may improve through character options and various items and services (a bath, grooming, and laundry). For more information, see pages 156 and 168.</p><p><strong>Income:</strong> This is your monthly take from properties, businesses, scams, and other monetary endeavors. You earn the listed silver at the end of each month, and may collect it at the start of each adventure or any Downtime lasting 1 month or more.</p><h2>PRUDENCE</h2><p>Your Prudence reflects how disciplined you are with your time and money. As your Prudence increases, you reap greater lasting rewards from your adventures and Downtime efforts.</p><p><strong>Money Saved/Earned:</strong> This is the maximum percentage of coin in hand you may transfer into your stake at the end of each adventure. This percentage is also used when earning money during Downtime (see page 68).</p><h2>GETTING STARTED</h2><p>You begin with Panache and Prudence scores of 0. You may distribute any Lifestyle gained from Origin, class, and feats as you like. Finally, you gain or lose Lifestyle equal to your Charisma modifier. This cannot reduce your Panache or Prudence below 0.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Aaron is a Level 1 Courtier with a Charisma score of 16. He starts with 0 Panache and 0 Prudence but gains 3 Lifestyle from his Charisma modifier and another 2 from his class. He increases his Panache to 1 and applies the rest of his Lifestyle to Prudence. He starts play with Panache 1, Prudence 4, and a total Lifestyle of 5.</p><div style=\"margin-left:-5px;margin-right:-5px\"><div style=\"float:left;width:50%;padding:5px\"><h4>Table 4.1: Panache Benefits</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Appearance</th><th>Bonus</th><th>Income</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>+0</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>+0</td><td>10s</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+1</td><td>20s</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+1</td><td>30s</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+1</td><td>40s</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>+2</td><td>50s</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>+2</td><td>60s</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>+2</td><td>70s</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>+3</td><td>80s</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>+3</td><td>90s</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>+3</td><td>100s</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>+4</td><td>110s</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>+4</td><td>120s</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style=\"float:left;width:50%;padding:5px\"><h4>Table 4.2: Prudence Benefits</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Prudence</th><th>Money Saved/Earned</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>45%</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>70%</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>75%</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"CARRYING CAPACITY","type":"text","_id":"1amUeZrbRqCW7CDY","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>You can only carry what your body frame and Strength allow.

When a number follows the name, the item is sold in lots of that size.</p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> A brief summary of the item’s game effect.

When items are purchased in bundles, as with arrows, this is the weight of a single item.</p><p><strong>Era:</strong> The earliest Era in which the item is likely to appear: Primitive, Ancient, Feudal, Reason, or Industrial (see page 305).</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> The item’s base value in silver pieces.</p><p>While the gear tables cover most common adventuring gear they’re not a comprehensive catalogue of everything possible in a setting. The GM may occasionally need to introduce new items to support the plot or the players’ ingenuity, in which case he should devise stats by comparison with listed gear. A new item’s stats should always be recorded in case it’s needed again.</p><h1>UPGRADES</h1><p>Items can be customized with upgrades, which are listed at the end of a gear table when they’re available. These modifications allow for hundreds of variations on each item, improving or worsening quality and various stats. In particular armor and weapons can be upgraded to produce unique creations, making a hero’s arms and appearance a distinct part of his legend.</p><p>Each upgrade may be added to an item only once. Also, no combination of upgrades may increase an item’s Complexity above 50; such items may only be introduced by the GM. Upgraded items tend to (dramatically) multiply an item’s cost.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A hollow, durable, masterwork music box costs 469s. As seen on Table 4.6 (see page 158), a music box has a cost of 75s. The 3 upgrades multiply this by a total of 525% (100% for durable, 25% for hollow, and 400% for masterwork).</p><h1>AVAILABILITY</h1><p>Your search for adventure may lead you far and wide, from tiny villages to bustling cities, and the same gear may not be available everywhere. Some areas might be too remote for anything but the basics, or the locals might refuse to sell to “outsiders.” At his discretion, the GM may impose limited availability, asking characters to make a check to find desired gear. Alternately, he could simply rule that certain items are unavailable in the setting (see page 318).</p><p>When availability is limited, the party names the item(s) they’re after and make a team Haggle check, taking the time and applying the modifiers listed on Table 4.4: Gear Availability (see above). Sellers are found offering each item with a Complexity score up to the Haggle result; all other items are unavailable in the area at this time.</p><h4>Table 4.4: Gear Availability</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Population</th><th>Haggle Check Time</th><th>Availability Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>None (No inhabitants; abandoned ruins, wilderness)</td><td>1d6 days</td><td>–20</td></tr><tr><td>Rural (1–50 inhabitants; small farm, frontier settlement)</td><td>4d6 hours</td><td>–10</td></tr><tr><td>Sparse (51–200 inhabitants; village, isolated hamlet)</td><td>2d6 hours</td><td>–5</td></tr><tr><td>Average (201–1000 inhabitants; town, independent outpost)</td><td>1d6 hours</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dense (1001–5000 inhabitants; large town, castle)</td><td>1d4 hours</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Urban (6001–25,000 inhabitants; city, port)</td><td>1d4 hours</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td>Sprawling (25,001+ inhabitants; capital city, bazaar)</td><td>1d6 hours</td><td>+20</td></tr><tr><td>Primary inhabitants are adversaries</td><td>×2</td><td>–10</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td></td></tr></tfoot></table><h1>DAMAGE</h1><p>An item’s Damage save bonus determines how well it resists damage. Most items with stats already have a Damage save bonus but for those that don’t, and for scenery such as chairs, doors, windows, consult Table 4.5: Item Damage Saves (see right).</p><p>When an item or piece of scenery takes damage, it makes a Damage save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the damage inflicted (rounded down). With success, the item or scenery may suffer scratches, dings, and other cosmetic flaws but there’s no mechanical effect. An item that fails the number of saves listed on Table 4.5 is broken and must be repaired before it can be used again (see page 73). When scenery is broken, a hole is punched through it large enough to accommodate a character of smaller Size. An item or piece of scenery that fails twice the listed number of saves is ruined beyond repair. At best, a ruined item or scenery may be scavenged for raw materials (see page 356).</p><p>Unlike damage inflicted to a standard NPC, item damage does not linger or accumulate. Items and scenery save against each damage value independently.</p><p>The following special rules apply to attacks against items.</p><p>• Attacks with the armor-piercing or keen qualities add those modifiers to the damage inflicted on an item.</p><p>• When an item fails a save against damage with a blast increment (see page 214), it fails 1 additional save per 10 points of difference between the result and the DC (e.g. a save result of 16 against a DC of 34 translates to a total of 2 failed saves).</p><p>• With a critical hit, the number of saves failed, if any, is doubled (e.g. an item that would suffer 2 failed saves from an attack instead suffers 4 failed saves with a critical hit).</p><h4> Table 4.4: Gear Availability</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Construction/Scale</th><th>Damage Save Bonus</th><th>Number of Saves</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Construction</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Brittle (paper, ice, glass, sand)</td><td>+0</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Soft (cloth, dirt, leather)</td><td>+5</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Hard (bone, metal, stone, wood)</td><td>+10</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><th>Size/Thickness</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Nuisance (N) or up to 1 in. thick</td><td>–4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Fine (F) or 2 in. thick</td><td>–2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Diminutive (D) or 3 in. thick</td><td>+0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny (T) or 6 in. thick</td><td>+2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Small (S) or 9 in. thick</td><td>+4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Medium (M) or 1 ft. thick</td><td>+6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Large (L) or 2 ft. thick</td><td>+8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Huge (H) or 3 ft. thick</td><td>+10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan (G) or 6 ft. thick</td><td>+12</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal (C) or 9 ft. thick</td><td>+15</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Enormous (E) or 12 ft. thick</td><td>+20</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Vast (V) or 15+ ft. thick</td><td>+25</td><td>12</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"GENERAL EQUIPMENT","type":"text","_id":"m5IWacLUB9x1TL44","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This category includes adventuring tools (or “kits,” which are used to perform various skill checks), as well as minor items that characters often find useful.</p><h1>GOODS</h1><p>Goods are essential survival equipment — lanterns, loadbearing gear, and other handy devices that can mean the difference between life and death for a stalwart adventurer.</p><h2>GOOD DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p><strong>Astrolabe: </strong>These sturdy moon and star charts act as early calendars, indicating the day, month, and year.</p><p><strong>Axe, hand: </strong>A dull axe made to split wood.

Samples of classic location traps can be found in Chapter 7 (see page 338).</p><p>Arming (locking) a lock is a Handle Item action. Hiding a trap is a 10-minute Stash action. Arming a trap requires 10 minutes, a trigger (installer’s choice with GM’s approval), and a target chosen from the options on Table 4.8: Locks &amp; Traps (see page 161). When a character triggers a trap, he must make a successful Reflex save (DC 15) or suffer the listed effect.</p><p>An armed lock or trap is Disabled with the Prestidigitation skill (see page 79). This is sometimes a Complex Task involving the number of Challenges shown on table 4.8. A disabled lock or trap may be Dismantled (see page 73).</p><h1>LOCK &amp; TRAP DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p><strong>Combination Lock:</strong> This sophisticated lock uses tumblers with codes rather than keys, making it much harder to Disable.</p><p><strong>Crushing Trap:</strong> The trap dumps or swings heavy objects onto the target, knocking him off his feet.</p><p><strong>Explosive Trap:</strong> Mines, shrapnel-blasting booby traps, and exploding runes are all examples of explosive traps.</p><p><strong>Fear Trap:</strong> Gory wards or blasphemous symbols turn weakwilled targets away without physical harm.</p><p><strong>Jaw Trap:</strong> Also known as a bear trap, this device snaps closed, clamping the target in the trap’s metal teeth.</p><p><strong>Net Trap:</strong> Popular with slavers and big game hunters, this trap is spread across the ground or hung from trees, rising up around or dropping down upon the unwary and unfortunate.</p><p><strong>Padlock:</strong> This common lock employs a key and tumblers.</p><p><strong>Pinlock:</strong> This early, simple lock uses wood pins or lengths of rope instead of tumblers.</p><p><strong>Pit Trap:</strong> A trench or chute disguised with leaf litter, a false floor, or sometimes an illusion.</p><p><strong>Projectile Trap:</strong> This trap hurls darts, arrows, or other deadly projectiles.</p><p><strong>Snare Trap:</strong> Ropes tied to springs or tree branches grab their victim by a limb and prevent their escape.</p><p><strong>Spike Trap:</strong> Sharpened stakes or rocks swing or spike up out of the ground, impaling the victim.</p><h1>LOCK &amp; TRAP UPGRADES</h1><p><strong>Bigger Area:</strong> The trap affects a larger area — and potentially more targets.</p><p><strong>Complex Mechanism:</strong> The lock or trap uses a unique key, chemical trigger, or other sophisticated mechanism that makes disabling it and taking it apart much harder.</p><p><strong>Durable:</strong> The lock or trap is constructed with extra care or heavier materials, ensuring it can stand up to rough treatment. The number of Damage saves it may fail before being broken increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Hair Trigger:</strong> The trap’s trigger is extraordinarily sensitive and more difficult to avoid.</p><p><strong>More Damage:</strong> The trap features deadlier armaments or methods (such as spikes in a pit trap or logs bashing into those caught in a jaw trap), inflicting 2 additional dice of damage.</p><p><strong>Poison:</strong> The trap employs spikes, needles, gas vents, or other ways to poison victims.</p><p><strong>Second Trigger:</strong> The trap has a second trigger, making it harder to evade. Even with a successful Reflex save, the victim suffers 1/2 the trap’s damage (rounded down).</p><p><strong>Unusual Damage:</strong> The trap inflicts damage through unconventional means, such as spiked balls in a crushing trap or acid filling a pit.</p><p><strong>Unusual Mechanism:</strong> The lock or trap’s interior workings are unique, frustrating would-be raiders.</p><h4>Table 4.8: Locks &amp;

are one-use “pocket spells,” allowing spellcasters to reach beyond their knowledge. They’re usually recorded on paper, hide, or stone but they can just as easily be chiseled onto branches, inscribed onto metal plates or armor, painted onto walls, or even worked into sand.</p><p>Only a character with the Spellcasting skill may use a scroll and the process is similar to casting a spell, though no spell points are spent. The caster doesn’t have to know the spell, nor must he be able to normally cast spells of its level. He spends the Casting Time reading the scroll (minimum 1 full action) and makes a Spellcasting check (see page 111). With success, the spell is cast and the scroll is destroyed. With failure, the spell fails but the scroll is retained and may be used again. A critical failure ruins the scroll.</p><p>To craft scrolls, a character must possess the Scribing Basics feat (see page 98).</p><p>When desired, the spell a scroll contains may be randomized on Table 3.2: Spells (see page 114).</p><h1>SCROLL UPGRADES</h1><p><strong>Heavy Material:</strong> The scroll is made of a soft material (e.g. cloth, leather, etc.).</p><p><strong>Solid Material:</strong> The scroll is made of a hard material (e.g. bone, wood, etc.).</p><h4>Table 4.13: Scrolls</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Spell Level</th><th>SZ/Hand</th><th>Const</th><th>Comp</th><th>Weight</th><th>Era</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">0</td><td>T/2h</td><td>Brittle 2</td><td>12D</td><td>1/10 lb</td><td>Ancient</td><td>25s</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1</td><td>T/2h</td><td>Brittle 2</td><td>15D</td><td>1/10 lb</td><td>Ancient</td><td>50s</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">2</td><td>T/2h</td><td>Brittle 2</td><td>18D</td><td>1/10 lb</td><td>Ancient</td><td>100s</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3</td><td>T/2h</td><td>Brittle 2</td><td>21W</td><td>1/10 lb</td><td>Ancient</td><td>200s</td></tr><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Scroll Upgrades</th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Heavy Material</td><td>—</td><td>Soft 2</td><td>+2</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Ancient</td><td>+10%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Solid Material</td><td>—</td><td>Hard 2</td><td>+5</td><td>3 lbs.</td><td>Ancient</td><td>+25%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1200000,"name":"SERVICES","type":"text","_id":"mV0U2JGonVF3Do8k","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>For the weary traveler, a hot meal or a warm bed can be worth a king’s ransom. Likewise, the assistance of a surgeon, tailor, guide, or consort may be just what an adventurer needs to win the day. Services are all the things characters hire others to do for them. Since they can’t be crafted, the Complexity column on Table 4.14 is replaced with Availability, which is used to determine whether a certain service is offered in the area.</p><p>Superior services, such as legal pardons and hired muscle, are Favors secured with Reputation (see page 187).</p><h1>SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p><strong>Announcement:</strong> Town criers, street corner poets, and loose-lipped snitches can be paid to spread a simple one sentence notice through the local populace in 1 day. This doesn’t guarantee that anyone will believe the message — that’s up to the GM. To determine randomly whether a specific character believes, the GM can make a Persuade check using the skill bonus of the crier, poet, or snitch.</p><p><strong>Bath:</strong> Often a rare luxury for adventurers, a bath improves the purchaser’s Appearance bonus by +1 for the current scene.</p><p><strong>Carousing:</strong> Nothing’s better for blowing off steam and getting a little perspective than a night out on the town. An evening of carousing heals all accumulated stress damage and grants Stress Resistance 4 for the current scene.</p><p><strong>Consort:</strong> A welcoming pair of open arms or ears isn’t quite as effective as a full night of debauchery but it’s enough to take the edge off. Hiring a consort heals 1/2 accumulated stress damage (rounded down), and grants Stress Resistance 2 for the current scene.</p><p><strong>Delivery:</strong> A courier, mage, or informant delivers a message or item up to Small Size. Couriers are likely to charge more to cross dangerous or rugged terrain and Travel Speeds are modified by terrain (see page 371). The delivery is obvious to observers and subject to the rigors of the road; the GM may spend 2 action dice to waylay the delivery with brigands, monsters, a natural disaster, or another hazard of his device. Each redundant or decoy delivery sent along with the main one increases this cost by 1 action die (maximum 4).</p><p><strong>Fortune:</strong> The ramblings of an oracle, seer, or gypsy can provide unique insight in the form of a free hint from the GM.</p><p><strong>Grooming:</strong> Barbers and attendants help a hero look his best, improving his Appearance bonus by +1 for the current scene. This bonus doesn’t stack with the grooming kit (see page 156).</p><p><strong>Healer Visit, Short:</strong> A quick visit to a bone setter or bloodletter can help a hero get back on his feet. A short healer visit grants the benefits of a successful Mend check.</p><p><strong>Healer Visit, Extended:</strong> Paying a nurse or healer to keep a watchful eye grants the benefits of a successful Treatment check once per day of the character’s stay.</p><p><strong>Hired Passage:</strong> Purchasing space in a caravan or on a galley ensures mostly reliable and relatively safe travel — mostly. It doesn’t guarantee that corrupt guides and porters won’t try to take advantage of the party, nor does it protect them from dangerous fellow travelers, but at least they won’t get lost (see page 371). If the GM rolls for random travel encounters, there’s also a smaller chance that the trip will be rudely interrupted (see page 372).</p><p><strong>Item, Commissioned:</strong> When an item isn’t available, a character can hire a craftsman to build it. It costs twice the item’s listed cost and takes a number of (D)ays, (W)eeks, or (M)onths equal to the item’s Complexity divided by 10 (rounded up). No skill checks are made — the craftsman simply produces the item.</p><p><strong>Item, Repair:</strong> Hiring a craftsman to repair an item costs half the item’s listed value (rounded up). It takes a number of days equal to the item’s Complexity divided by 10 (rounded up), and restores the item to full operation (no Damage saves failed). No skill checks are made — the craftsman simply repairs the item.</p><p><strong>Laundry:</strong> Cleaning and repairing an outfit improves the wearer’s Appearance bonus by +1 for the current scene.</p><p><strong>Legal Advocate:</strong> Hired counsel represents a character in the court of the land, whether it be a holy or military tribunal, a judge and jury, or gathering of tribal leaders. This grants the character a +2 or +5 morale bonus with skill checks made in a trial (see page 320).</p><p><strong>Library Access:</strong> Any respectable library is well organized and contains hundreds of books, making Research checks much easier (of course, the books may or may not have anything to do with the information a character wants). At the GM’s discretion, a library in a major city might contain thousands of books or more, and specialize in any topic sensible for the area and its history.</p><p><strong>Lodging, Poor:</strong> Barns and flophouses are cheap but uncomfortable. A character “enjoying” poor lodging receives only shelter, not food, and starts the next day with the fatigued I condition.</p><p><strong>Lodging, Common:</strong> Common houses, hostels, and space around the hearth at an inn are standard fare for many adventurers. A common dinner is provided with each night’s stay.</p><p><strong>Lodging, Fancy:</strong> A private room at an inn, residence, or guest house offers comfort and solitude, along with three square (common) meals.</p><p><strong>Lodging, Luxurious:</strong> Rare unless the character is the guest of a noble, successful merchant, or other wealthy benefactor, luxurious lodging offers all the comforts of home — including 1 unspiced option from Table 4.11 (see page 165). The GM may choose the option (based on the nature of the lodging) or let the players choose from a menu.</p><p><strong>Lodging, Extravagant:</strong> The pinnacle of lavish living, extravagant lodging includes a helpful inn owner or personal assistant who performs or acquires 1 community service other than a commissioned item from Table 4.14 (see page 168). The GM may choose the service offered (based on the nature of the lodging) or let the players choose from options available in the area.</p><p><strong>Scribe:</strong> A scribe can be hired to write a character’s spoken words or duplicate a non-magical document.</p><p><strong>Stabling, Poor:</strong> Tying a mount, pet, or other animal to a post under an awning is cheap but doesn’t do the animal any favors. The animal isn’t fed (at least, not by the owner of the lodging), and starts the next day with the fatigued I condition.</p><p><strong>Stabling, Common:</strong> Stabling an animal for the night keeps it warm, dry, and fed for the day.</p><p><strong>Stabling, Veterinary:</strong> A skilled and caring animal healer can provide the benefit of a short or extended healer visit, and feed guests as well.</p><h4>Table 4.14: Services</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:130px\">Service</th><th>Effect</th><th style=\"width:70px\">Availability</th><th style=\"width:55px\">Era</th><th style=\"width:40px\">Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Community Services</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Announcement</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Spreads news to the local population in 1 day</td><td>5</td><td>Primitive</td><td>3s</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Bath</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 to user’s Appearance (current scene)</td><td>10</td><td>Ancient</td><td>5s</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Carousing, 1 night</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Heals all stress damage;

A character and his vehicle follow the rules for mounted combat (see page 215). A vehicle’s Initiative and saving throw bonuses are +0 and its Defense is listed on Table 4.16: Vehicles (see page 171). Some vehicles can’t Run and no vehicle can become sprawled. Vehicles suffer all damage from normal hits but with a critical hit the attacker may spend 2 action dice to instead hit an occupant or draft animal (if one is present).</p><p>Due to the unique rules for vehicles, Table 4.16 features some different columns.</p><p><strong>Speed: </strong>The vehicle’s Ground Speed, used in combat and movement. When another Speed follows in parentheses, it’s the vehicle’s Run distance. These values override animal statistics when the vehicle is drawn.</p><p><strong>Travel: </strong>The vehicle’s Travel Speed in miles per hour (see page 371). As with Ground Speed, this value overrides animal statistics when the vehicle is drawn.</p><p><strong>SZ/Def: </strong>The vehicle’s Size and Defense.</p><p><strong>Occ/Load: </strong>The number of Medium characters (including driver) and total weight the vehicle may carry.</p><h2>VEHICLE QUALITIES</h2><p><strong>Cover: </strong>The vehicle offers protection from outside attack, granting the listed cover to occupants. This cover only applies in the vehicle’s “open areas,” such as a boat’s deck, from which an occupant may attack.</p><p><strong>Crew: </strong>The vehicle requires a minimum number of characters to function.</p><p><strong>Draft: </strong>The vehicle requires a minimum number of animals or characters as its source of locomotion.</p><p><strong>Overrun: </strong>The vehicle is designed to ram enemies or run them down. During a Run, the driver may direct the vehicle to Trample as a free action, inflicting the lethal damage listed in parentheses with a hit.</p><h2>VEHICLE DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p><strong>Balloon: </strong>This early lighter-than-air vehicle lets a small party avoid travel encounters on the ground but it’s also at the mercy of the wind.</p><p><strong>Barge: </strong>This smooth-bottomed, river-going cargo hauler may be pulled by a swimming draft team or float with the current.</p><p><strong>Canoe: </strong>This light, slender boat is made of hide or wood and guided by paddle.</p><p><strong>Cart: </strong>This simple draft wagon has one axle and a flat bed for hauling cargo.</p><p><strong>Chariot: </strong>This early horse-drawn war machine smashes through enemy lines at great speeds.</p><p><strong>Catamaran: </strong>This sea-going vessel connects two canoes by platform, offering much greater stowage. It’s often upgraded with a sail.</p><p><strong>Coach: </strong>This enclosed, two-axle wagon is a common conveyance of nobility and the wealthy.</p><p><strong>Flying Carpet: </strong>This extremely rare and wondrous vehicle can carry two at great speed and rolls up for easy storage (if sapient, it might even roll itself up).</p><p><strong>Frigate: </strong>The pinnacle of naval warfare, a frigate often bristles with guns and combat-ready mariners.</p><p><strong>Galley: </strong>This multi-purpose sailing ship is useful in trade and battle.</p><p><strong>Ironclad: </strong>A seaborne tank, this early metal ship is terrifyingly effective in war.</p><p><strong>Litter/Palanquin: </strong>This throne or lounging seat is carried on the shoulders of human bearers.</p><p><strong>Longship: </strong>This small, nimble warship is a favorite of sea raiders and can be carried across land for short distances.</p><p><strong>Mechanical Wings: </strong>This bizarre mechanical contraption is worn like a backpack and lets the wearer fly like a bird.</p><p><strong>Raft: </strong>This simple floating platform is guided by paddle, pole, or sail.</p><p><strong>Rowboat: </strong>This small watercraft is guided by row or sometimes a small sail.</p><p><strong>Siege Tower: </strong>This massive, fortified tower moves on rollers or wheels and is used to attack enemy fortifications.</p><p><strong>Sled: </strong>This smooth-bottomed platform is pulled across snow by dogs or other draft animals.</p><p><strong>Stagecoach: </strong>This heavy wagon is fully enclosed (and often armored), though cargo and the driver usually sit outside.</p><p><strong>Wagon: </strong>This two-axle cargo hauler is pulled by a single steed or horse team and provides decent cover during poor weather.</p><h2>VEHICLE UPGRADES</h2><p><strong>Agile: </strong>The vehicle is unusually maneuverable, gaining a +2 gear bonus to Defense. This bonus also extends to the vehicle’s driver.</p><p><strong>Armored: </strong>The vehicle is fitted with armor plates or durable materials, gaining a +2 gear bonus with Damage saves.

Armor is graded by coverage: partial (10–40%), moderate (50–80%), or full (90–100%). The greater the coverage, the more difficult it is for opponents to use certain actions and abilities, including Called Shots (see page 221).</p><p>Partial armor covers the torso alone while moderate armor covers both the torso and legs. Light or heavy fittings may be added to armor (not thick hide), adjusting its base values. Heavy fittings also increase the armor’s coverage by 1 grade (from partial to moderate, or from moderate to full). For a more detailed but complex armor system, and a greater view of how fittings play into armor, see Descriptive Armor, right.</p><p>A character may only wear armor of his exact Size. Armor Size affects cost and weight (see the footnote on Table 4.17: Armor, page 174).</p><p>The armor tables feature several different columns.</p><p><strong>Damage Reduction (DR):</strong> Damage Reduction granted by the armor. This decreases to 1/2 (rounded up) when the wearer is held, helpless, pinned, sprawled, or unconscious.</p><p><strong>Resistances:</strong> Damage Resistance granted by the armor.</p><p><strong>Defense Penalty (DP):</strong> A penalty applied to the wearer’s Defense and Reflex saves.</p><p><strong>Armor Check Penalty (ACP):</strong> A penalty applied to the wearer’s physical skill checks.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> A penalty applied to the wearer’s Speed (to a minimum of 5 ft.).</p><p><strong>Disguise:</strong> A modifier to Disguise checks targeting the wearer, whether they’re made to conceal the armor or not (it’s more difficult to look like someone else, or some specific, when you’re weighed down with protective gear). ‘Obvious’ means the wearer can’t be disguised at all.</p><h2>SHIELDS</h2><p>Shields are carried by hand and may be used as weapons, so they’re described in the weapons section (see page 177).</p><h4>Table 4.17: Armor</h4><table

These values assume armor for a Medium character. For smaller characters they drop by 50% per Size (rounded down), and for larger characters they increase by 300% per Size.<br /><strong>Barding:</strong> In the Feudal and later Eras, barding may be made of any armor. Barding is specific to each species of animal or beast.<br /><strong>Unborn:</strong> In any era in which Unborn are present, armor may be built into or removed from their bodies with a successful Build or Improve check against the armor’s Complexity + 10.</p><h2>ARMOR DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p><strong>Articulated Plate:</strong> The pinnacle of armorsmithing excellence, this option adds sliding plates over joints and other areas still exposed by platemail.</p><p><strong>Chainmail:</strong> Sheets of interlocking metal rings bend like cloth but can absorb blows and prevent cuts.</p><p><strong>Hardened Leather:</strong> This armor consists of rigid plates of boiled and treated leather. It offers impressive protection but also prevents fluid movement.</p><p><strong>Leather:</strong> Animal hides and tanned leather are light and flexible but still absorb minor punishment.</p><p><strong>Padded:</strong> This armor consists of layers of padding or quilted fabric. It helps with cold weather but isn’t stitched from sturdy enough materials to protect against attacks.</p><p><strong>Platemail:</strong> This armor strategically places large metal plates over a leather or chainmail undergarment. It offers incredible damage protection but also severely impacts mobility.</p><p><strong>Scalemail:</strong> This armor consists of an interlocking mesh of metal plates or ‘scales’ over a leather or padded undergarment. Long, horizontal plates are sometimes used, in which case this armor is called banded or splint mail.</p><p><strong>Studded Leather:</strong> This improved leather armor adds studs, rings, and other metal pieces to guard against blades. It’s sometimes called ringmail.</p><h1>ARMOR UPGRADES</h1><p>There are 3 types of armor upgrade: craftsmanship, which adjusts the design to a particular culture, technique, or style (in this case, species); materials, which change composition; and customization, which applies general changes like tailoring, ornamentation, and spiritual blessings.</p><p>Each armor may only have 1 craftsmanship and 1 materials upgrade at a time, though any number of customizations may be applied. Also, species craftsmanship is only possible if the species exists in the campaign (check with the GM if you’re unsure).</p><p>Upgrades may not be applied to fittings and may not decrease any armor

throwing spear. It lets the wielder whip the loaded projectile with much greater force, gaining more range and punching power.</p><p><strong>Blowgun: </strong>This long tube propels darts with more precision. It’s common among assassins and tribal warriors.</p><p><strong>Bola: </strong>This weapon consists of 2–4 weights on a cord. It’s thrown at a target’s legs, entangling them.</p><p><strong>Bomb: </strong>A primitive grenade made of iron or stone, the bomb is most popular in ship-to-ship and siege warfare.</p><p><strong>Boomerang: </strong>This throwing stick’s wing design guides it back to the wielder with a miss.</p><p><strong>Chakram: </strong>This sharpened steel ring is thrown like a discus and casually saws through flesh on impact.</p><p><strong>Concussion Bomb: </strong>This bulky, gunpowder-laden grenade stuns and terrifies troops rather than kill them.</p><p><strong>Dart: </strong>This hand-thrown or blowgun-fired missile is made of a weighted wooden rod sharpened at its end, or topped with a pointy spike.</p><p><strong>Flash Bomb: </strong>This tiny, hand-thrown explosive often consists of an eggshell filled with alchemical powders. It’s common among thieves and assassins, especially when they need to mask an escape.</p><p><strong>Greek Fire: </strong>The original “sticky bomb,” greek fire is a flammable mixture of oil and tar in a glass or clay sphere. It’s lobbed at the decks of wooden ships and from the ramparts of assaulted fortresses.</p><p><strong>Harpoon: </strong>This weapon’s wicked point and fine throwing balance make it much more than a seaborne hunting weapon.</p><p><strong>Javelin: </strong>This small and light spear is specifically designed for throwing. It’s often used by skirmishers and light infantry.</p><p><strong>Lasso: </strong>The simplest of capture devices, this weapon is nothing more than a rope tied with a quick-knot eyelet. Just loop it over the prey and pull.</p><p><strong>Net: </strong>Like the lasso, the net inflicts no damage, but it’s incredibly useful for snaring and slowing enemies.</p><p><strong>Rocks: </strong>Sometimes enemies are just a stone’s throw away. Remind them of it.</p><p><strong>Shuriken: </strong>“Ninja stars” and sharpened coins are mostly used for distraction and delivering poison.</p><p><strong>Sling: </strong>Perhaps the simplest of ranged weapons, the sling turns any Fine or smaller object into a weapon with exceptional distance and moderate power</p><p><strong>Staff Sling: </strong>This large sling’s long handle allows for up to Tiny bullets at the expense of range.</p><p><strong>Throwing Knife: </strong>While too flimsy for the rigors of hand-to- hand combat, this compact weapon is ideal for finishing off a weakened target.</p><h4>Table 4.21: Hurled Weapons</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th

These exceptional rewards might be found or claimed (e.g. an abandoned tomb you decide to spruce up and call home), taken from fallen enemies (e.g. a magic relic you take from a defeated foe), or bestowed by a grateful community or patron (e.g. a constable who promises to help you in the future for protecting his town from a raiding party). Regardless of their origin, however, these rewards are kept by spending Reputation points, the currency of heroism.</p><p>Reputation points are earned for achieving victories during adventures (see page 342), and may be spent to increase Renown (your standing in various circles). Renown has a variety of effects, among them setting the maximum number of Prizes you can keep at any time. As illustrated in the previous examples, Prizes include Contacts, Favors, Holdings, and Magic Items, each described in a later section.</p><h2>GETTING STARTED</h2><p>A new character’s Reputation points are equal to his Career Level × 10. He may spend some or all of this to increase his Renown and, if the campaign allows, buy one or more Prizes; otherwise, a character starts with no Renown or Prizes.</p><h2>LOSING PRIZES</h2><p>The spoils of glory are often fleeting: titles can be stripped away, friends can die in battle, territories can be raided or destroyed, and relics can be shattered or stolen. Losing a Prize can be a devastating blow and it takes time for a hero’s legend to recover. As with silver, spent Reputation doesn’t magically reappear when a Prize is lost; the hero must continue to adventure to gain more. Whether a hero replaces a lost Prize with newly gained Reputation is a choice for tomorrow.</p><h1>RENOWN</h1><p>One of the most common uses for Reputation is building Renown, which measures your social standing and public recognition. Renown is key to your progression, representing not only your popularity and title but also your growing legend, which is reflected in the number of Prizes you can keep and the favors you can request.</p><p>Renown is a score divided into three tracks: Heroic (fame and sway with the people of the world), Military (respect and duty paid by armies and police forces), and Noble (stature and influence in circles of political power). Optionally, your GM may introduce new Renown tracks unique to the setting and story (see page 317).</p><p>Each point of Renown costs 30 Reputation and may be invested in a Renown track of your choice, marking your growing standing in the world. Each Renown track caps out at 10, and Renown may only be purchased between adventures.</p><h2>THE BENEFITS OF RENOWN</h2><p>Renown confers a number of benefits, some for total Renown (the sum invested in all Renown tracks), others for Renown in a specific track.</p><p>Title: Your Renown in each track grants you a title that’s commonly used to describe and refer to you. A list of default titles is found on Table 4.26: Titles (see right), though the GM may develop new ones for your world setting.</p><p>Recognition and Reactions: The higher your total Renown, the greater the chance that others have heard of you. Once per scene, you may request that any NPCs who can see and hear to make a team Knowledge check (DC 20), adding 1/2 your total Renown as an insight bonus (rounded down). With success, they recognize you, recalling your name and titles.</p><p>Calling in Favors: Your progress along each Renown track also gives you pull within a segment of the populace (the people for Heroic Renown, the armed forces for Military Renown, and the leadership for Noble Renown). This pull lets you spend Reputation to call in a wide variety of Favors (see below).</p><p>Keeping Prizes: You may keep a number of Prizes equal to your total Renown + 1 at the end of each adventure. If you have more, you must give the excess to other characters or “discard” them (e.g. release a contact from service, relinquish the deed to a holding, or donate a magic item to the town’s city guard).</p><p>Purchasing Prizes (GM Approval): During Downtime of a week or more, your GM may permit you to “buy” new Prizes with a Reputation cost up to 10 × your total Renown. No actual currency exchanges hands; these Prizes are acquired by pulling strings and taking advantage of relationships.

In all cases the characters are putting their names on the line for a Favor, which in game terms translates to spending Reputation for a potent, one-time benefit.</p><p>To call in a Favor, you must have the required Renown, devote the minimum Downtime, and spend the Reputation listed on Table 4.27: Favors (see page 188). You must also be in or near a population center or be able to communicate with allies who can plausibly provide the Favor. You may only call in each Favor once per adventure, though you can keep it as a Prize if you’d prefer not to use it immediately. You may only keep 1 of each Favor as a Prize at any time, even if the Favor can grant multiple effects (e.g. you may keep 1 Basic Feat Training Favor and 1 Advanced Feat Training Favor, but only 1 of each).</p><p>The GM determines who can provide each Favor, though you can and should make suggestions, especially among NPCs who’ve already appeared in the game. To use a Favor you must be able to communicate with the NPC or group providing it. A Favor is lost once it’s used, though you may call it in again during a later adventure by spending more Reputation.</p><p>Not all Favors of the same type are identical. Safe passage across a quiet area populated with well-meaning folk is a far cry from safe passage across the same distance in hostile wilderness. The GM can and should increase a Favor’s cost based on the circumstances. Generally, no Favor should exceed triple the listed cost, even for the most outlandish requests.</p><p>As many Favors can potentially upset or derail adventures, the GM may disallow each Favor request by spending 2 action dice, in which case the Reputation spent to call the Favor in is returned. Though not required, the GM should always try to offer a story reason for refusing a Favor (e.g. following this section’s initial examples, the knavish court member might enjoy popular support, the bandit might be on the run, the captain’s troops might be committed elsewhere, or the wizened master might be on a vision quest).</p><h2>FAVOR DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> The party receives a divine mandate or religious endorsement and the corresponding benefit from Table 4.27 for the rest of the adventure. This might involve moral and spiritual support or an actual gift from the gods, depending on the nature of the campaign.</p><p><strong>Combat Training:</strong> The character receives intense training in new weapons or combat maneuvers, gaining 1 proficiency or trick for the rest of the adventure.</p><p><strong>Decree:</strong> The law of the land shifts, creating a government sanctioned holiday, instating a new law, or suspending an existing law for rest of the scene (see page 319).</p><p><strong>Delivery:</strong> A courier, mage, or informant delivers a message or item up to Small Size. Unlike transport bought with silver, the delivery is entirely secret and arrives without incident. Travel Speeds are still modified by terrain, however (see page 371).</p><p><strong>Detention:</strong> An NPC or group is arrested and locked up without trial by the military or local watch. This Favor’s Reputation cost is determined by the length of the detention and the Disposition of the military or local watch commander toward the target(s).</p><p><strong>Diversion:</strong> The character’s allies create a spectacle that distracts observers, inflicting a penalty on their Notice and Search checks. A minor diversion might be a staged duel or a carriage accident, a moderate one could be a fire or explosion, and a major one could be a riot or the destruction of an entire building.</p><p><strong>Event:</strong> The character’s allies put on a festival, rally, protest, or other large gathering, summoning a number of NPCs for a period deemed appropriate by the GM.</p><p><strong>Feat Training:</strong> The character undergoes a crash course to temporarily develop a talent or special ability. He gains one of the listed temporary feats for the rest of the adventure. These feats are exclusive and do not grant previous feats in the same chains (i.e. Advanced Feat Training does not also grant a Basics feat).</p><p><strong>Harassment:</strong> The character’s allies emotionally hassle an NPC (e.g. undermining or humiliating them), mentally (e.g. keeping them from sleeping or relaxing), or physically (e.g. roughing them up or arranging harmful “mishaps”). This inflicts various penalties with all the target’s actions for the rest of the scene.</p><p><strong>Hirelings:</strong> The party employs a mob of standard NPCs or a single special NPC for the rest of the scene. The NPC(s) may be built from scratch or chosen from the Rogues Gallery (see page 244). They’re controlled by the GM, have a Disposition of 10, and assist the party in any way that doesn’t place them in unreasonable jeopardy. This option covers all the myriad types of hirelings the characters may want, from mercenaries to sages to thieves to guides.</p><p><strong>Invitation:</strong> The party gains access to a restricted event, secure location, or protected NPC. The invitation lasts for the scene, the event’s duration, or until the NPC’s patience runs out, whichever comes first.</p><p><strong>Language Training:</strong> The character is tutored in one foreign tongue and may communicate with it, albeit in a broken fashion, for the rest of the adventure.</p><p><strong>Loan:</strong> The character borrows an item or money, promising to return it before the end of the adventure. If he reneges, he pays this Favor’s Reputation cost again and may gain a Debt Subplot of equivalent value (see page 382).</p><p><strong>Pardon:</strong> The character or 1 other character escapes punishment for 1 crime (see page 320).</p><p><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> The party taps into a network of scouts, spies, or seers to get a “lay of the land” or “word on the street.”</p><p><strong>Rumor:</strong> The character fires up the local rumor mills, starts a whisper campaign, or uses town gossips to change the public’s opinion toward 1 character or group.</p><p><strong>Safe Haven:</strong> The party “lays low” with standard NPC friends who feed and possibly assist them. The friends also lie to keep the party’s location a secret and fight to give the party time to escape should danger intrude on the safe haven. When needed, the GM chooses the friends’ stats from the Rogues Gallery (see page 244).</p><p><strong>Safe Passage:</strong> The party is safely escorted or transported to a destination of their choice (no chance of travel encounters).</p><p><strong>Skill Training:</strong> Friends offer the character special insight into the use of a single skill. He gains the listed ranks in 1 skill for the rest of the adventure.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The character employs a magic user to cast a spell on his behalf (with a Casting Level equal to the adventure’s Threat Level). Due to the powerful and flexible nature of magic, even when it’s restricted in the setting (see page 314), the GM is advised to carefully consider spellcasting Favors and deny any that might upset the game. Should a spellcasting Favor be denied, it should not become available later without a reasonable story justification.</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> The character employs an expert or craftsman to perform a single task for them.</p><h4>Table 4.27: Favors</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Favour</th><th>Renown Requirement</th><th>Minimum Downtime</th><th>Reputation Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Blessing — Party receives 1 benefit for the adventure:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Luck (+1 with action die results)</td><td>Heroic 2</td><td>—</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Protection (+1 with Defense and saves)</td><td>Heroic 4</td><td>—</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Rage (+1 with attack and damage rolls)</td><td>Heroic 6</td><td>—</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Victory (action die cost to activate threats and errors decreases by 1, minimum 0)</td><td>Heroic 8</td><td>—</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Combat Training — Character receives 1 proficiency or trick for the adventure</td><td>Any 1</td><td>W</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Decree: Alter local law for the scene:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Holiday (Suspend work and government activity)</td><td>Military or Noble 2</td><td>D</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Instate minor law</td><td>Military or Noble 4</td><td>W</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Suspend minor law</td><td>Military or Noble 6</td><td>W</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Instate major law</td><td>Military or Noble 8</td><td>W</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Suspend major law</td><td>Military or Noble 10</td><td>W</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Delivery — Safe transport of 1 message or Small item:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Neighboring (within 50 miles, 1 day of travel)</td><td>Any 1</td><td>—</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Regional (within 500 miles, 1 day per 50 miles of travel)</td><td>Any 3</td><td>—</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Remote (over 500 miles, 1 day per 50 miles of travel)</td><td>Any 5</td><td>D</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Detention: Imprison 1 NPC without trial:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">For 1 day</td><td>Military or Noble 4</td><td>—</td><td>5 + 1/2 Disposition (rounded down)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">For 1 week</td><td>Military or Noble 6</td><td>—</td><td>10 + 1/2 Disposition (rounded down)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">For 1 month</td><td>Military or Noble 8</td><td>—</td><td>15 + 1/2 Disposition (rounded down)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Indefinitely</td><td>Military or Noble 10</td><td>—</td><td>25 + 1/2 Disposition (rounded down)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Per additional 5 characters detained</td><td>+1 (maximum 10)</td><td>—</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Diversion — Arrange spectacle:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Minor (observers suffer –2 penalty with Notice and Search checks for 1 minute)</td><td>Any 2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Moderate (observers suffer –4 penalty with Notice and Search checks for 2d6 minutes)</td><td>Any 4</td><td>—</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Major (observers suffer –10 penalty with Notice and Search checks for 4d6 minutes)</td><td>Any 6</td><td>D</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Event — Draw people to a gathering:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Small (local protest/private event;

Unlike other NPCs, a contact is predisposed to like and help the character out of friendship, loyalty, or obligation.</p><p>Each contact is a Prize and therefore gained by spending (in this case, leveraging) Reputation, though some character options grant them as well. Not all characters have contacts — deep friendships and abiding trust aren’t part of every hero’s tale.</p><p>To establish a contact, a character may either choose an existing NPC with a minimum Disposition of 16 or create a new one, paying Reputation equal to 1/2 the NPC’s base XP value, rounded up (complete rules for creating NPCs can be found on page 225). Contacts may be offered at no cost as an Instant Reward — assuming the characters treat them well (see page 344).</p><p>The reason(s) for a contact’s support should be determined before the contact enters play, and it’s a good idea to note a few additional details about the contact as well. At the very least every contact should have a name and home location. Adding one to three background details (banker to the Crown, owns hundreds of books, former militiaman) and/or one to three personality quirks (jovial, womanizing, afraid of horses) will help the Game Master run the contact in an expected fashion, rather than making them up on the fly when the contact is called upon.</p><p>The Game Master must approve each new contact before it enters play, even if the contact is granted by a character option. Like everything in this chapter, contacts shouldn’t replace a character’s raw ability and the GM should be mindful of ways that contacts might be used — intentionally or accidentally — to circumvent or undermine a campaign’s challenge. For instance, a diplomat might be a great contact in a political intrigue game, so long as he doesn’t wind up doing all the talking for the party. Generally, contacts should be making the characters’ lives a little easier or getting them out of minor binds rather than replacing their need to adventure.</p><h2>TRUST</h2><p>A contact’s willingness to help is determined by his Trust. In order from lowest to highest, contacts with each level of Trust are called <strong>acquaintances</strong>,<strong> associates</strong>, <strong>confederates</strong>, and <strong>partners</strong>. Unless otherwise specified, a newly established contact always begins as an acquaintance.</p><h4> Table 4.28: Trust</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Trust</th><th>Persuasion Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Acquaintance</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Associate</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Confederate</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Partner</td><td>50</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>CALLING ON A CONTACT</h2><p>Everyone lives somewhere and most people will only travel so far from home — even for friends. A contact’s home is set when he’s gained and only the GM may change it later (though the player may lobby for a contact to move if it suits the game’s story).</p><p>Each character may only call on a contact once per scene and each individual contact may only be approached once per adventure. A character may only call upon a contact with whom he can communicate; in a fantasy game, this may often mean that the character must go to the contact to request help.</p><p>The purchase of a contact represents kindness the character has extended and the contact is happy to return the favor. When called upon, a contact helps to the best of his ability as if the character had generated the Impress/Persuade result shown on Table 4.28: Trust (see above).</p><p>No skill check is required to gain a contact’s help, but there’s only so much help to go around. When called upon, a contact assists the character and his party either with 1 task or until the end of the following scene, whichever comes first (the player must define both). Of course, the circumstances may dictate that a contact can’t or shouldn’t leave when his generosity runs out, in which case he leaves at the first reasonable opportunity and the character’s Reputation decreases by 1 per additional scene the contact helps.</p><p>Contacts may help with Downtime checks but may not make Downtime checks of their own.</p><h2>IMPROVING A CONTACT</h2><p>At the end of each adventure during which a contact was called upon, the character may spend 25 Reputation to increase the contact’s Trust by 1. Further, with GM approval, the contact’s statistics may improve, increasing his XP value by up to 10 at an equal cost in Reputation.</p><p>In the event that a contact is killed, abandoned, or otherwise removed from play, the character regains 1/2 his invested Reputation (rounded up). This includes Reputation spent to increase the contact’s statistics and Trust but not Reputation lost if the contact was forced to linger for more than one scene.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":2600000,"name":"HOLDINGS","type":"text","_id":"sOUV7ikdNy1JdvWj","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Homes, hideouts, houses you rent, and places you squat are all holdings. Each holding is a separate Prize with a Scale ranging from 1 to 12, as shown on Table 4.29: Holding Scale (see right). A holding’s Scale determines the maximum number of guests you can host and shelter there (in addition to yourself).</p><p>A holding’s Reputation cost is also listed on Table 4.29 and additional Reputation may be spent to improve a holding with Assistants, Fortifications, Guards, Rooms, and Tradesmen, as described in the following sections. Holdings may be acquired in any of the ways a magic item can (see page 193).</p><p>The Scale of each of your holdings may not exceed the higher of your Panache or Prudence.

The more detail you can lavish on holdings the better; these are places where you and your party should be spending a lot of Downtime, and perhaps even the odd scene or two.

Each Assistant grants a bonus with checks made using a single skill. This bonus is determined by the Reputation invested, as shown on Table 4.30: Holding Upgrades (see page 193). An Assistant may be improved between adventures and counts as a guest in the holding. They will not accompany the party outside the holding. The combined bonuses granted by all Assistants at a single holding may not exceed the holding’s Scale; when they do (e.g. because of new or improved Assistants), you must dismiss enough Assistants to bring the combined bonuses under this limit.</p><h1>FORTIFICATIONS</h1><p>Unwelcome visitors face additional challenges when trying to enter a fortified holding. Entering when the location is secure becomes a Complex Task with DCs and a number of Challenges determined by the Reputation invested, as shown on Table 4.30: Holding Upgrades (see page 193). The specific skills used to overcome each Challenge must be determined and approved before a fortification enters play. Work with the GM to find suitable options (e.g. Athletics to swim across a moat, Investigate or Survival to locate a concealed lair, etc.)</p><h1>GUARDS</h1><p>Holdings may permanently house defenders to protect it from incursion. Each complement of guards consists of a number of standard NPCs equal to 1/3 the holding’s maximum guests (rounded down), and requires a Reputation investment equal to the NPC’s XP value. Guards may be built from scratch or chosen from the Rogues Gallery (see page 244), and must be approved by the GM before they enter play. Guards will not accompany the party outside the holding. A holding may benefit from no more than 3 guard complements at a time and each individual guard counts as a guest.</p><h4>Table 4.30: Holding Upgrades</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Reputation Investment</th><th>Assistant Bonus</th><th>Fortification Challenges</th><th>Tradesman Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1</td><td>+1</td><td>2 (DC 14)</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3</td><td>+2</td><td>3 (DC 18)</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">6</td><td>+3</td><td>4 (DC 22)</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">10</td><td>+4</td><td>5 (DC 26)</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">15</td><td>+5</td><td>6 (DC 30)</td><td>+8</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>ROOMS</h1><p>Special rooms can be built into holdings, providing benefits to you and your guests when you’re there.

They may only leave if released by you, a guest, or someone who defeats the holding’s Fortifications and Guards.</p><p><strong>Stables:</strong> This Room may contain a number of animals equal to the holding’s Scale. Once per adventure, each animal at the Stables may be fed for 1 day. Also, the threat range of each Breed Animal or Train Animal check made at a Stables increases by 3.</p><p><strong>Throne Room:</strong> The Impress threat range of each character residing at the holding improves by 3.</p><p><strong>Torture Chamber:</strong> The Intimidate threat range of each character residing at the holding improves by 3.</p><p><strong>Vault:</strong> This hidden Room may only be found with a successful Search check (DC 25) and may only be breached with a successful Prestidigitation check (DC 25).

Each Tradesman makes a single Downtime check to earn income at the end of each adventure (see page 68), using the length of time since the end of the last adventure and the skill bonus shown on Table 4.30: Holding Upgrades (see left). A Tradesman may be improved between adventures and counts as a guest in the holding. The specific skill each Tradesman uses must be determined before he enters play. Tradesmen will not accompany the party outside the holding. A holding may benefit from no more than 3 Tradesmen.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":2700000,"name":"MAGIC ITEMS","type":"text","_id":"ieDSc3YxEX87KMnu","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Magic items are a staple of most fantasy settings: legendary swords, ancient stone orbs infused with the spirits of forgotten kings, crumbling scrolls containing powerful secrets of lost arts… These precious and often unique objects grant a seemingly infinite variety of benefits, all the stuff of high fantasy. Even so, not all heroes possess magic items — supernatural objects and tools can be out of character for the self-reliant and superstitious, and other characters may not wish to tarnish their accomplishments with speculation that they couldn’t have been earned with skill alone. When kept, magic items become part of a character’s growing legend. For this reason each magic item is a Prize and counts toward the maximum number of Prizes permitted by his Renown (see page 187).</p><h2>GAINING AND LOSING MAGIC ITEMS</h2><p>During an adventure, you might seize magic items from defeated adversaries and captured treasure hordes. You might also find them in dungeons and other locations in the wild. Beneficent patrons and grateful NPCs you’ve saved might bestow them on you as recompense for a job well done. The GM built these items into the adventure and they’re yours to keep without cost. They still count toward your maximum Prizes, however.</p><p>If the setting permits, you might decide at some point to craft a magic item, in which case you’re sacrificing Downtime — and precious training in the form of the Charm Binding and/or Essence Binding feats (see pages 96 and 97) — but you gain the item without further cost.</p><p>Then there’s “buying” magic items, which is often disallowed (check with the GM before marching off to a vendor). Even the lowliest magic item is essentially priceless, its value impossible to gauge in mere coin. When magic items can be bought, the only currency precious enough to compare is a character’s good name among friends and across the world: his Reputation. To “purchase” a magic item, you must pay the item’s total Reputation cost, including all Essences and Charms (see page 195). This is true whether the item is actually bought (in a very high-magic campaign where the forces of creation are displayed in shop windows) or leveraged away from its former owner (for example, by burning some of your standing to convince a noble to part with a prized heirloom). Even when this option is allowed, your accumulated Reputation will only carry you so far — you may only “buy” magic items with a Reputation cost up to your Renown × 10.</p><p>When magic items can be “bought,” they can also be “sold,” yielding half their Reputation value (rounded down). You can keep this Reputation (e.g. generating some good will by “gifting” the item to a worthy cause, like the city guard), or apply it toward the cost of a purchased item.</p><p>As with any Prize, losing a magic item for any reason — theft, destruction, or misplacing it — yields nothing; it is simply gone.</p><p>The GM must approve all magic items before they enter play, whether they’re found, seized, crafted, or purchased.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A Career Level 6 metalsmith with the proper Gear feats sets out to create a magic metal shield with the Lesser Vitality Essence and the Lesser Defense Charm — the “Stalwart’s Shield” (see page 201). At its initial Level (6), the item has a total Reputation cost of 15. During Downtime, the metalsmith makes Crafting (Metalworking) checks to generate Reputation until he amasses the 15 he needs to complete the shield. At that point he claims the magic item as a Prize at no additional cost.</p><p>Later, a young knight is awarded the shield by the head of his family in recognition of his fine exploits and growing prominence in the kingdom. The knight pays 15 Reputation for the shield and adds it to his list of Prizes.</p><p>Unfortunately, the knight is soon eaten by a dragon and the shield becomes part of the creature’s horde. A decade later, adventurers slay the beast and claim the shield as an adventure reward at no Reputation cost.</p><h2>USING MAGIC ITEMS</h2><p>Using a magic item is generally as simple as donning a piece of clothing or wielding an object. Items that require activation may be triggered with a Handle Item action defined by the object’s creator (e.g. mental command, manipulating the object, uttering a word or phrase, etc.), and Charms and Essences that don’t require activation may likewise be turned on or off with a Handle Item action. Discovering how to trigger a magic item can become part of the play experience and may require specialized research or even completing a new adventure.</p><h4>Table 4.31: Random Magic Items</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>d20 Result</th><th>Essences and Charms</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1–2</td><td>1 Lesser Essence</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3–4</td><td>1 Lesser Charm</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">5–7</td><td>1 Greater Essence</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">8–10</td><td>1 Greater Charm</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">11–15</td><td>1 Lesser Essence &amp; 1 Lesser Charm</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">16–17</td><td>1 Greater Essence &amp; 1 Lesser Charm</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">18–19</td><td>1 Lesser Essence &amp; 1 Greater Charm</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">20</td><td>1 Greater Essence &amp; 1 Greater Charm</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>BUILDING MAGIC ITEMS</h2><p>Whether found, seized, crafted, or purchased, every magic item possesses 1 Essence and/or 1 Charm (but no more). An Essence is an effect that’s innate to the object or the substance from which it’s made, while a Charm is an effect that’s imbued or forged into the object when it’s awakened (i.e. made magical). The specific Essences that are linked to each object or substance are left to the GM (so they can fit the setting and story), but they can just as easily be left undefined, part of the mystery behind the mojo.</p><p>The GM chooses a magic item’s Essence and/or Charm when the item is introduced, and will usually build items into the plot of each adventure. When magic items can be crafted, the creator may choose an item’s Essence and/or Charm from those he is able to imbue, though GM approval is still required (see page 318). The same is true when shopping (the GM determines what’s available in a given market). For those who wish to be surprised, random results are available on Table 4.31: Random Magic Items (see above).</p><p>A magic item also has a level ranging from 1 to 20. Like its Essence and/or Charm, an item’s level is usually chosen by the GM and should usually be equal to the adventure’s Threat Level (see page 335). The level of a crafted magic item is commonly equal to the creator’s Career Level (see page 27). Among other things, an item’s level is used to determine its Charm Bonus, which is critical when determining Reputation cost.</p><p><em>Example:</em> In the previous example, the weapon smith was Level 6 when he created the Stalwart’s Shield. Thus, the item’s level was also 6, which produces a Charm Bonus of +1. The shield’s total Reputation cost is 15 because the Lesser Vitality Essence has a cost of 12, its Lesser Defense Charm Bonus of +1 has a cost of 8, and the item is 1-handed, which decreases its overall cost by 5. All these numbers can be found on Table 4.32: Essences and Charms (see page 195).</p><p>Every magic item is a single object that conveys its benefit only while whole and unbroken. Most magic items are portable but there’s no reason a throne or fountain couldn’t be one as well (in fact, these items make great additions to a location the GM wants the players to return to again and again). Magic items can’t be combined or merged and even if they’re made part of a larger object each individual magic item counts against your maximum Prizes.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A glove has four inlaid gems, each with 1 Essence and 1 Charm. Despite the fact that the glove is a single item it’s the gems that are magical and so the glove counts as 4 Prizes.</p><p>Except in games where magic is ubiquitous, every item should also have a background, even if it’s (initially) unknown to the party. Magic items are special and should have names and history, often linked to their Essences and Charms. When brainstorming these details it’s often best to imagine who created the item and why, where they were and what they were doing, and why they needed the item in the first place. Unless the item’s still in their possession when the party finds it, you might also consider others who’ve owned it and the role the item played in their lives. Granting an item this kind of history grounds it in the setting and story, and goes a long way toward making it a memorable facet of play (as opposed to a bundle of bonuses).</p><h4>Table 4.32:

Just as Excalibur to Arthur and Sting to Bilbo, such a pivotal object can become a unique fixture in a hero’s life, as integral to his legend as his fellow party members. In Fantasy Craft these remarkable items are called “artifacts.”</p><p>An artifact differs from a traditional magic item in the following ways.</p><p>• An artifact may have up to 5 Essences and 5 Charms, all chosen by the GM. Most of the time these will be determined once when the artifact is created and won’t change through its lifespan. In a particularly evolving storyline the GM may decide to hold certain Essences and/or Charms back until certain events or actions occur in the game but he should still decide on all of them before the artifact is introduced.</p><p>• An artifact’s level can advance with that its owner. At any time when a character’s Career Level is higher than his artifact’s level, he may spend Reputation to increase the artifact’s level to match his own. This costs Reputation equal to the character’s Career Level × 2.</p><p>• Because an artifact is intrinsically linked with its owner, attribute bonuses it grants are considered permanent changes (i.e. they can affect his vitality, wounds, skill points, Lifestyle, etc.).</p><p>• Each hero may possess only 1 artifact at a time. Should a character abandon his artifact, he loses Reputation equal to his Career Level. He may regain the same or another artifact at a later time.</p><p>Artifacts cannot be purchased or crafted in any way — they’re introduced strictly by the GM, usually to satisfy a specific need in the setting or storyline. Typically they’re built into an adventure though the GM might occasionally ‘awaken’ a traditional magic item after it’s used extensively in a pivotal adventure. This approach can be particularly satisfying as it emphasizes an item the player already knows and uses. In both cases the artifact becomes an adventure reward.</p><h2>ESSENCE DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p>Essences are fixed benefits the magic item or artifact grants regardless of the item’s level.</p><p>All of an Essence’s details — such as the specific Alignment conveyed by Aligned Damage and the specific School affected by Casting Level Bonus — must be chosen when the item is introduced and cannot change. An Essence may be applied to an artifact as many times as there are unique details for that Essence (e.g. Aligned Damage may be applied once per available Alignment). When no details must be chosen, an Essence may only be applied once.</p><p><strong>ACP Negation:</strong> The item decreases your Armor Check Penalties by 2.</p><p><strong>ACP Negation, Greater:</strong> The item negates your Armor Check Penalties.</p><p><strong>Aligned Damage:</strong> If the item is a weapon, attacks with it gain 1 Alignment available in the setting; otherwise, all your attacks of the 1 type (unarmed, melee, or ranged) gain the Alignment.</p><p><strong>Casting Level Bonus:</strong> If your Casting Level is at least 1, the item increases it by 2 when casting spells of 1 School.</p><p><strong>Class Ability:</strong> The item grants 1 class ability offered by the cross-training ability (see page 47). If you already have the ability, this Essence has no effect.</p><p><strong>Class Enhancement:</strong> The item is attuned to 1 specific base or expert class. If you have at least 1 level in that class, the item grants the next level’s class abilities. You gain no other benefits from the next level, such as skill points, vitality, base attack bonus, save bonuses, etc. If you have no levels in the class or have reached its maximum level, this Essence has no effect.</p><p><strong>Damage Aura:</strong> Each time an adjacent opponent hits you with an unarmed or melee attack the item inflicts 1d6 damage (or 1d10 damage for a Greater Damage Aura) of a type listed on Table 4.34: Damage Auras (see below).</p><h4>Table 4.34: Damage Auras</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>d20 Result</th><th>Damage Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">2</td><td>Divine</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3–4</td><td>Electrical</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">5–6</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">7–8</td><td>Force</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">9</td><td>Sonic</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">10</td><td>Stress</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">11</td><td>Subdual</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">12–13</td><td>Blunt (subdual)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">14–15</td><td>Edged (lethal)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">16–17</td><td>Cold (subdual)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">18–19</td><td>Heat (subdual)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">20</td><td>Poison (any 1)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Damage Reduction:</strong> The item grants DR 2 against all damage except attacks with 1 Alignment available in the setting.</p><p><strong>Damage Resistance:</strong> The item grants Damage Resistance 4 (or 10 for Greater Damage Resistance) against 1 damage type listed on Table 4.35: Damage Resistance (see below).</p><h4>Table 4.35: Damage Resistance</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>d20 Result</th><th>Damage Type or Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">2–3</td><td>Cold</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">4</td><td>Divine</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">5–6</td><td>Electrical</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">7–8</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">9–10</td><td>Force</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">11–12</td><td>Heat</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">13–14</td><td>Sonic</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">15</td><td>Blunt weapons</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">16</td><td>Edged weapons</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">17</td><td>Ranged weapons</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">18</td><td>Natural attacks</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">19–20</td><td>Spells</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Edge Surge:</strong> Once per combat, the item may be triggered to gain 2 Edge (4 Edge for Greater Edge Surge).</p><p><strong>Exotic Damage:</strong> If the item is a weapon, its damage shifts to 1 different type; otherwise, all your attacks of 1 type (unarmed, melee, or ranged) inflict 1 alternate damage type.</p><p><strong>Feat:</strong> The item grants 1 temporary feat listed on Table 4.33: Feats (see page 197).

This ensures that newly found magic items gradually improve over the life of the campaign, and it’s the cornerstone for artifact advancement.</p><p>As with an Essence, all of a Charm’s details must be chosen when the item is introduced and cannot change. Each Charm can be applied as many times as there are unique details for it.</p><h4>Table 4.37: Charm Bonuses</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Level</th><th>Lesser Bonus</th><th>Greater Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">2</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3</td><td>+1</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">4</td><td>+1</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">5</td><td>+1</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">6</td><td>+1</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">7</td><td>+2</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">8</td><td>+2</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">9</td><td>+2</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">10</td><td>+2</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">11</td><td>+2</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">12</td><td>+2</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">13</td><td>+3</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">14</td><td>+3</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">15</td><td>+3</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">16</td><td>+3</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">17</td><td>+3</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">18</td><td>+3</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">19</td><td>+4</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">20</td><td>+4</td><td>+7</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Accuracy Bonus:</strong> If the item is a weapon, it grants a magic bonus with attack checks made using it as shown on Table 4.37: Charm Bonuses (see above); otherwise, all your attacks of 1 type (unarmed, melee, or ranged) gain this bonus.</p><p><strong>Attribute Bonus:</strong> The item grants a magic bonus to 1 attribute as shown on Table 4.37: Charm Bonuses.</p><p><strong>Bane:</strong> If the item is a weapon, its threat range increases against 1 creature type as shown on Table 4.37: Charm Bonuses; otherwise, your threat range with all attacks against the creature Type are increased.

If needed, the Casting Level is equal to the item’s level. You need not be a caster to use the item or trigger the spell effect and no Spellcasting check is required. The spell’s save DC is calculated using the wielder’s stats. Any special requirements — such as completing a Subplot to cast a Wish — must still be satisfied before the spell may be cast.

{"name":"Chapter 7: Worlds","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"WORLD BUILDING","type":"text","_id":"RlXf7yPw5kyBi7Vp","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>A new setting starts with a general concept and improves with every specific decision. You don’t have to decide everything before you play — just the bits that are critical to the story you’d like to tell and the backgrounds of the characters the players are building. Often, you can begin with just a paragraph or two and expand as you go, discovering the world as you present it to the players. This works best for groups that have previously enjoyed fantasy RPGs together, especially if they’ve developed expectations about the worlds their characters inhabit.</p><p>For other groups, and those unsure where to start, this section offers a comprehensive approach, starting with general decisions and moving toward narrow ones. To get started, ask yourself a question.</p><h2>WHAT’S THE SPIRIT OF YOUR GAME?</h2><p>This can be a tricky question to answer but it’s also one of the most important. It’s difficult because it’s deceptively complex, touching on many facets of play, but that’s also why it’s important. Defining spirit sets many expectations right up front, giving you a point of reference when making other decisions about your game. It eases the rest of the world building process. Consider what you’re after when playing a fantasy RPG. Are you mostly interested in bold and bloody action? Intense character drama? Light-hearted comedy? Complex courtly intrigue? The thrill of exploration and discovery? As you can see, the “spirit” of your game is all about how you feel when you’re playing. That’s the core of the question: what do you want your game’s emotional impact to be?</p><p>If you’re unsure, you might want to think about your favorite fantasy movies, books, and video games. What do you get out of them? Ask the same of the players and look for common ground. Imitation being one of the sincerest forms of flattery, it’s perfectly acceptable to borrow flavor and even concepts. It can also makes the game more accessible, which generally translates to more fun — and fun is never bad or wrong.</p><h2>WHAT’S YOUR GAME’S GENRE?</h2><p>Another way to narrow your options and help your world take shape is to define your fantasy genre. This basic list is by no means complete but it covers the most common options.</p><p><strong>Traditional Fantasy:</strong> Sometimes called “high fantasy,” this genre focuses on the struggle between good and evil in a world of magic and monsters. Examples: Lord of the Rings; The Hobbit; The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; Dungeons &amp; Dragons</p><p><strong>Sword and Sorcery:</strong> This genre features brave heroes, visceral action, romance, and corrupting magic. Though the heroes may change the world, it’s often by accident. Examples: Conan; Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser; Elric of Melnibone</p><p><strong>Dark Fantasy:</strong> This offshoot genre infuses sword and sorcery with horror. The bad guys have won, evil is absolute, and the “good guys” are merely the least selfish of the bunch. Examples: Mistborn; The Black Company; Midnight; Ravenloft</p><p><strong>Epic Fantasy:</strong> Like the champions of Greek and Norse myth, this genre’s heroes are godlings, legendary generals and warriors slaying unique monsters, crushing nations, and determining the fate of the entire world. Examples: God of War; Beowolf; King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table</p><p><strong>Gonzo Fantasy:</strong> Typified by Japanese pop culture and wuxia films, this relatively new genre shamelessly embraces the most extreme elements of the spectrum, reveling in over-the-top humor, melodrama, and action. Examples: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Final Fantasy; Avatar: The Last Airbender; Naruto; World of Warcraft</p><p><strong>Political Fantasy:</strong> This genre is fraught with intrigue and danger, the heroes navigating a complex landscape of clashing kings and warring states. Examples: A Song of Ice and Fire; Birthright</p><h2>WHAT’S YOUR GAME’S ERA?</h2><p>Fantasy RPGs can span many time periods and technologies, making cultural touchstones a valuable tool in establishing your world’s baseline. Medieval Europe is the most common inspiration but your game could just as easily present the exploits of prehistoric barbarians, Renaissance swashbucklers, mystical Victorians, or a thousand other characters throughout history.</p><p>For simplicity, Mastercraft divides time into “eras,” each grouping a set of roughly concurrent social, cultural, and technological advancements. The Fantasy Craft “baseline” covers four eras: primitive, ancient, feudal, and reason. A fifth era, industrial, is presented to allow for slightly “futuristic” games.</p><p>Your choice of era determines the gear available in your game (as shown on the tables throughout Chapter 4).</p><h3>PRIMITIVE</h3><p>The earliest era covers the dawn of civilization, before the foundations of the world’s first great societies. In many ways, it’s analogous to the real world’s Stone Age and Neolithic period.</p><p>The most common social unit of the primitive era is the tribe — a collection of individual family groups sharing resources and skills to survive. Most tribes survive as hunter-gatherers, living off the land and following migrating herds of animals as they move with the seasons.</p><p>The peoples of a primitive world are culturally unsophisticated. They rarely possess a written language, though pictographs may be common. Most live in relative isolation and languages are often confined to single tribes or close clusters of tribes.</p><p>Leaders are named in many ways. Some are divinely inspired and others gain rank through age and wisdom. Still others benefit from lineage, heroic deeds, or conquest. Warfare is generally limited to minor skirmishes and raids sparked by old feuds and desire for resources. Wandering warriors and tribal champions often become heroes in primitive settings as professional soldiers and standing armies are virtually unheard of.</p><p>Primitive technologies are based on items that are easily cultivated or modified. Metalworking is either non-existent or extremely rare, so most tools are simple and crafted from natural materials such as stone, bone, shell, obsidian, and wood. Clothing and armor are made from leather, hides, fur, and soft plant materials like cedar, grass or reeds. Transportation centers on beasts of burden and early domesticated animals like horses, mastodons, and other riding animals.</p><p>Medicine and magic are rarely distinguishable in the primitive era, with herbs, naturally-occurring drugs, and animal materials being the most common components of both tonics and spellcasting. Primitive magic often focuses on channeling natural forces and beings, while religions draw power from animistic spirits of nature, their ancestors, or great abstracted gods.</p><h3>ANCIENT</h3><p>The ancient era is more sophisticated and structured than its predecessor, pioneering the first steps toward science, literature, and lasting cultural advancement. Ancient societies span the Bronze Age through the classical antiquity of our world, with examples including Egypt, Greece, Rome, Sumer, India, Mexico, and China.</p><p>The basic social unit of an ancient campaign is the city-state, a small independent nation built around a particular ideal, culture, religion, or ruling dynasty that outlasts any one family or individual. Unlike primitive tribes, city-states are permanent and have set social, political, and economic structures based on birthright, species, military status, or other qualities. This complexity lets a few ancient societies grow into kingdoms, empires, or even dynasties lasting centuries and encompassing huge swaths of land.</p><p>Ancient cultures feature spoken and written languages, commonly shared across great distances thanks to expansion and conquest. Education is available but the new disciplines of literacy and philosophy are primarily confined to the wealthy and clergy. Trade and interaction with other city-states is common, and economic and political concerns are a key part of everyday life. Members of ancient societies no longer struggle to subsist, letting them specialize in trades and professions, or pursue education or the arts.</p><p>Leaders rise through many different means: social status, heredity, military conquest, popular support, and economic dominance are all common. A more diverse range of governments are seen here than in any other era, including autocracies, democracies, theocracies, and oligarchies. Warfare expands beyond simple skirmishes to bloody clashes over resources, trade, and territory, and standing armies press mercenaries, slaves, and citizens into service in roughly equal numbers.</p><p>Technology approaches but still falls a bit short of the “fantasy standard.” Weapons and tools are metal (typically copper, bronze, or iron). Armor and shields are made of leather or linen, often with metal scales or rings. Huge strides in engineering allow for magnificent buildings, aqueducts, efficient farming and transport tools, and devastating weapons of war. Domesticated animals are common and medicine comes into its own, surgeons and alchemists providing reliable cures for injury and disease.</p><p>Magic and faith are highly structured, featuring pantheons of deities with distinct personalities and benefactions. Mages are philosophers and mystics with solutions to problems that society’s nascent sciences can’t yet solve, though magic and technology remain close enough that mages are still learned and respected advisors, philosophers, and mystics. This changes quickly in the feudal era.</p><h3>FEUDAL</h3><p>The “classic” fantasy era is a time of kings, knights, wars, and princesses, resembling the Dark Ages to the Late Medieval period in our world. Society becomes even more structured, with massive political, military, and social systems dwarfing all but the most heroic individuals. This is the time of Charlemagne, Byzantium, Vikings, Samurai, the Moors, the Crusades, and the Hundred Years’ War.</p><p>The kingdom is the most basic feudal social unit, a fully-developed, well-armed culture with a defined social and political hierarchy. Small kingdoms rival ancient city-states, relying on trade and alliances to thrive while larger kingdoms can be entirely self-sufficient with regularly expanding borders.</p><p>Feudal societies perfect several ancient advancements, particularly those protecting the sovereignty of their leaders. Education is still uncommon but is also far more widespread, with books preserving knowledge for future generations. Languages encompass entire continents thanks to military conquest and expanding travel, though most people remain uneducated and agrarian. Strict social hierarchies limit social interaction and opportunities by class: nobility, clergy, military, and peasants.</p><p>Leaders typically gain authority by divine or heredity birthright (often, they are considered one and the same), though some earn it through conquest as well. Warfare is a premier art form, with national armies perpetually battling for king and country. Professional soldiers, such as knights and men-at-arms, may even form a warrior class, giving low-born citizens a chance to serve as a means of social advancement.</p><p>Like ancient culture, the era’s technology refines what’s come before. Iron and steel are widely used to manufacture weapons and armor, and complex blacksmithing techniques are making gear ever stronger and more deadly. Engineering provides feudal kingdoms with unassailable castles, magnificent places of worship, and massive siege engines to batter them down. Medicine advances but is still only available to the nobility.</p><p>Magic is as strictly segregated as social classes: divine casters are often missionaries of massive, structured faiths while arcanists lose traction in accepted circles. Increasing knowledge, the rising availability of machines, and the exhortation of the clergy make arcane casters less needed and less trusted, often driving them to form secret guilds and other elusive groups.</p><h3>REASON</h3><p>This is an era of incredible growth and discovery, of far-reaching exploration and conquest. New technologies and modes of travel bring wildly disparate cultures together for the first time, making it a turbulent and wondrous time to be alive. Reason encompasses our Renaissance period through our Age of Enlightenment.</p><p>The primary political and social units of the era are nations — autonomous, clearly defined countries with a distinct cultures and national identities. Not all nations are physically large but all maintain seasoned militaries and strong sets of values.</p><p>Culture is defined by curiosity and humanism, which is a far cry from the stricture and willful ignorance of the feudal era. Education, literacy, and knowledge are widely available to the masses for the first time, thanks to printing, philosophers, and national leaders. The inexorable advance of science and technology paves the way for amazing discoveries, freeing the common man to engage in professional and intellectual pursuits. Star-charting, refined mapping, and other navigation advances help explorers travel beyond and between continents, and languages spread through extensive trade, learning, and military networks.</p><p>Hereditary and military leadership are still most common but individuals also rise to power by accumulating wealth, gaining popular support, and simple, underhanded scheming. Nations may be led by a wider array of characters, including merchant princes and great philosophers. Warfare remains a vital facet of international relations and it’s bloodier than ever, though diplomatic and economic alliances are on the rise. ‘Warrior’ is a profession rather than a social caste.</p><p>Science impacts nearly every aspect of life. Gunpowder changes warfare forever, prompting armorers to shift away from heavy plate to light and flexible suits that encourage mobility (read: dodging). As an added benefit, these suits can also be worn socially, which helps to integrate warriors more fundamentally into other circles. Machinery is available and often mastered by common folk. Transport includes grand wagons and great ships (some even floating on air), and medicine becomes available to the masses through chemists and professional healers.</p><p>The advancement of science also has a great impact on religion and magic. As people gain new options for their ills, they start to rely less on their faiths, at least for healing. Technology continues to displace magic, forcing mages to specialize and cloister, though some embrace and change with the times. These few, and their divine counterparts, use their power in new and exciting ways, experimenting as much as the great thinkers of the time.</p><h3>INDUSTRIAL</h3><p>Steam, steel, and strife define this era, which is a time of empires, revolution, and the triumph of science. In these and many other ways, the industrial era is like our own 19th century.</p><p>The industrial era’s basic social unit is the empire, which acts like a nation but spans continents or even entire worlds. Empires are sometimes leagues of independent nations though they can also be massive colonizing powers ruled by a powerful individual or governing body. Relations between empires are formal and complex, and when war becomes the sentiment of the day it’s comparatively brief and decisive.</p><p>Refinement and pursuit of perfection are hallmarks of the industrial era. Colonizing powers seek to conquer their subjects militarily and culturally, stamping out “savage” peoples and converting those who submit. As a result, languages and faiths tend to spread worldwide, as do books and education. Long-distance communication methods develop toward the end of this era, permitting rapid communication between empires, and travel is likewise improved via steam-, coal-, and arcane-powered engines.</p><p>A new leader arrives in the form of the revolutionary, who employs radical ideas like socialism and democracy to fuel his cause. The revolutionary threatens the sovereignty of industrial empires, sparking as many internal wars as colonists ignite abroad. The status of the army is also in flux during this period, as common firearms cheapen life and let empires field less-trained warriors. The bloody meat-grinder of modern warfare is just a few steps away.</p><p>Industrial technology focuses primarily on speed and volume, drawing society away from artisanship to mass production of easily replaced items. Gunpowder weapons approach the apex of their development, making melee weapons and armor obsolete without specialized training. Complex devices like clockwork and steam-powered gadgets are increasingly common and locomotives, steamships, zeppelins, and other mechanical transports dominate the roads, rails, and skies of the world. Medicine is still crude by modern standards but is nonetheless an exacting science, with doctors and surgeons applying widely-accepted techniques.</p><p>Magic often combines with science in the industrial era, resulting in magical technologies beyond imagination. “Steampunk” sorcerers create lightning bolt guns, time-travel sleds, clockwork animals, and other wild gadgetry that baffles even modern minds. A few mages continue to reject science, however, retreating from society to become witches and cultists.</p><h2>WHAT DO PEOPLE BELEIVE?</h2><p>Belief systems are an integral part of fantasy, ranging from worship of specific, strongly characterized deities (as in the Norse, Greek, and Egyptian pantheons) to axiomatic moral codes (like Good, Evil, Order, and Chaos) to abstracted philosophies and cosmological viewpoints (like Far Eastern elemental affinities). Beliefs form a common ground for characters of diverse ethnicities, geographies, and occupations, and often drive devotees to rise above their roots, to get involved and potentially change the world.</p><p>In Fantasy Craft, beliefs are represented by Alignment. Each character may only have one Alignment at a time, though each Alignment may feature multiple beliefs.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A simple dark fantasy game may feature only two Alignments: Good and Evil. Characters without an Alignment are neutral, which means their beliefs either don’t fall in line with the world’s established faiths or are too mild to warrant a full Alignment.</p><p>Alternately, in a traditional fantasy game, each Alignment may consist of a single choice from each of two different pairs: Good or Evil, Order or Chaos. Characters can be Good and Order, Good and Chaos, Evil and Order, or Evil and Chaos. Again, neutrality means a character falls outside the accepted norms or is without powerful beliefs.</p><p>Ask yourself four primary questions when defining your world’s beliefs.</p><p>• What Alignments are available?</p><p>• How do Alignments impact society?</p><p>• Are miracles real?</p><p>• If miracles are real, how do they impact society?</p><p>Don’t worry if you’re not ready. These questions are important for every world but you may not have a firm enough handle on your idea to answer them yet. If that’s the case, skip forward to magic (see page 314) and come back to this section later.</p><h3>WHAT ALIGNMENTS ARE AVAILABLE?</h3><p>First and foremost, Alignments are optional. Not every world’s beliefs are strong or structured enough to require them, and unless miracles are real Alignments boil down to glorified Interests (see page 61). They can still be useful to support religious factions and as ways to expand character backgrounds, however.</p><p>If you want to include Alignments, consider the hallmarks of belief in your world. Concentrate on the things that attract the most loyal and/or numerous followers. Alignments can focus on anything: gods, moral codes, ethical ideals, rules of etiquette, viewpoints, elements, constellations, animals, bloodlines, nations, colors, symbols… The sky’s the limit. Your world can even feature Alignments of multiple types (bloodlines and stars, for example), though the options can get complex fast so it’s probably best to start small: pick one set and jot down all the options you’d like characters to have (e.g. for elements, you might jot down “Air, Earth, Fire, and Water”).</p><p>Likewise, Alignments can be organized however you want. Characters may choose one item from a list (one element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water), or choose one item each from multiple lists (e.g. Good or Evil and Order or Chaos). A character’s Alignment consists of all choices made. Remember, each character may only possess one Alignment at a time.</p><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Alignment</th><th>Alignment Skills</th><th>Paths</th><th>Ritual Weapon</th><th>Avatar</th><th>Opposed Alignments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Elements</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Air</td><td>Acrobatics, Blend, Investigate, Prestidigitation</td><td>Air, Travel</td><td>Boomerang</td><td>Air Elemental V</td><td>Earth</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Earth</td><td>Athletics, Crafting, Ride, Survival</td><td>Earth, Metal</td><td>Maul</td><td>Earth Elemental V</td><td>Air</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Fire</td><td>Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Ride</td><td>Fire, War</td><td>Jagged sword</td><td>Fire Elemental V</td><td>Water</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Water</td><td>Disguise, Search, Sneak, Tactics</td><td>Life, Water</td><td>Bullwhip</td><td>Water Elemental V</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Traditional Fantasy Alignments</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Chaos</td><td>Acrobatics, Disguise, Prestidigitation, Survival</td><td>Chaos, Destruction</td><td>Hand claw</td><td>Chaos Beast</td><td>Order</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Evil</td><td>Blend, Bluff, Ride, Sneak</td><td>Evil, Darkness</td><td>Scourge</td><td>Anarchy Demon</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Good</td><td>Athletics, Haggle, Ride, Tactics</td><td>Good, Light</td><td>Bastard sword</td><td>Guardian Angel</td><td>Evil</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Order</td><td>Crafting, Investigate, Search, Tactics</td><td>Order, Protection</td><td>Long staff</td><td>Stone Golem</td><td>Chaos</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>HOW DO ALIGNMENTS IMPACT SOCIETY?</h3><p>Alignment can be an integral and perhaps mandatory part of daily life (e.g. in a culture that reveres constellations and divides their calendar into seasons accordingly, everyone might be born under a specific group of stars), or it can be a decision made by worshippers (e.g. each character choosing whether to adhere to one of a common set of ideals or not). It can be based on irrefutable truth (e.g. gods who walk among men) or driven entirely by faith (e.g. cults formed around differing religious interpretations of ancient script, despite evidence that the script is nothing more than a mundane primitive language).</p><p>These are just two of the most profound ways Alignment can shape your world. There are, of course, countless more. Are established orders devoted to some or all Alignments, or are each character’s beliefs purely personal? If orders exist, how do they interact with each other and the rest of society? Are they endorsed by, sponsored by, or perhaps a part of the world’s governments (or vice-versa)? Do they have allies and enemies?</p><p>A character’s Alignment might demand little of him (e.g. mild dietary requirements or short, unobtrusive rituals) or represent a major commitment (e.g. daily regimen and/or hefty tithes). The same is true — perhaps more true — of orders focusing on Alignments, which often develop extensive expectations of members, along with detailed selection processes to dissuade casual observers.</p><p>If divine powers exist, they may be keenly interested in the lives of mortals (like the Greek gods) or they might be cold and indifferent (like the gods of Hyboria). They may exist in harmony or oppose each other (with obvious ramifications for believers should the powers make themselves known).</p><p>Again, skip ahead if you’re unsure how to address some or all of these possibilities. The gaps may be filled by other decisions in the world building process. If not, and you’re still unsure when you have what you consider enough to get playing, you can always follow up when you need to know.</p><h3>ARE MIRACLES REAL?</h3><p>In fantasy RPGs, belief can be a palpable force, gifting the devout with supernatural assistance and/or various controllable abilities and spells. This power can be granted by a god, tap latent reserves of mystic or magical clout, align a character with various sources of external energy, or come from somewhere else. You may define the source and nature of any miraculous power however you like but for the purposes of game play you only need to start with one question: Do miracles ever happen in any form? If not, you can skip forward to magic (see page 314).</p><p>If miracles do happen, start by applying the miracles campaign quality (see page 324). Then ask yourself two questions. The answer to one or both should be yes.</p><p>• Do characters benefit from unexpected miracles? If so, then you may (and periodically should) use Narrative Control to produce these effects (see page 366).</p><p>• Can characters invoke miracles? If so, then they need to gain access to Paths (see page 310). The most common way this occurs is through classes like the Priest and the Paladin (see pages 44 and 56), though the Blessed feat grants a single Step (see page 105). If you’d rather not feature divine caster classes, you can work Paths into another part the system, such as feats (1 Step per “New Step” feat) or Career Levels (1 Step every 2 or 4 Levels, starting at Level 1), though the latter isn’t balanced, increasing PC power at no actual “cost.”</p><p>When the miracles quality is applied, each Alignment also gains several game features defined by its concept and description (which can include its patronage(s), common followers, and any other details you deem relevant).</p><p><strong>Paths:</strong> Choose 2–5 Paths that flavorfully represent the Alignment (see page 310).</p><p><strong>Alignment Skills:</strong> Choose 4 skills, excluding any that are already class skills for one or more divine caster classes in your game (i.e. in the default Fantasy Craft game, which features the Priest and the Paladin, you should exclude Impress, Intimidate, Medicine, Notice, Resolve, or Sense Motive). The chosen skills become class skills for divine caster classes in your game.</p><p><strong>Ritual Weapon:</strong> Choose a specific weapon wielded by devout followers of the Alignment (e.g. a sickle for a nature deity or a broad axe for the god of executioners). Make sure this weapon is available in your game’s era.</p><p><strong>Avatar:</strong> Choose or build a specific NPC or creature, up to 120 XP, as the Alignment’s incarnate representative in the physical world (e.g. a Guardian Angel of Good or a Dire Mammoth for a Thunder Alignment).</p><p><strong>Opposed Alignments (Optional):</strong> Some Alignments clash so fiercely that their followers automatically become adversaries. In these cases the Alignments become “opposed,” triggering or altering many class abilities and spells.</p><p>Here’s an example. You can also find the traditional fantasy Alignments (Good and Evil, Order and Chaos) and an elemental set on Table 7.1: Example Alignments (see page 308).</p><h4>DEGMOS STONE-FATHER</h4><p>Degmos is the Dwarven patron of blacksmiths, warriors, and fathers. He’s a cold and stern god, and his clergy are grim and wizened, prone to espousing his manly wisdom on craft and home life to all who’ll listen (and some who’d rather not). Degmos’ devotees routinely wage holy crusades against the goblins threatening the god’s temples and protected territories.</p><p><strong>Paths:</strong> Earth, Metal, Strength</p><p><strong>Alignment Skills:</strong> Athletics, Crafting, Search, Survival</p><p><strong>Ritual Weapon:</strong> Mallet</p><p><strong>Avatar:</strong> Earth elemental V (see page 125)</p><p><strong>Opposed Alignments:</strong> Razgeth Bloodblade, Demon Lord of Goblins</p><h3>LOSING YOUR RELIGION</h3><p>Like characters, beliefs change over time: a god may abandon a character; an Alignment may become unavailable; or a significant event may leave a character questioning his values or even the order of the universe. Any situation in which the character loses his Alignment, voluntarily or not, prompts a Crisis of Faith Subplot (see page 381). In a game with the miracles quality, this Subplot gains several special rules.</p><p>• The character loses his Alignment but does not lose the Interest “slot” (see page 61). Instead, it becomes frozen until the Subplot ends, at which point he may fill the slot with his new Alignment.</p><p>• For the duration of the Subplot, the character loses access to his Alignment Paths, skills, avatar, class abilities, feat abilities, and other character options requiring or supporting an Alignment. He gains access to his new Alignment’s options and may re-allocate his Steps when the Subplot ends.</p><p>• The character retains his ritual weapon but loses access to any special abilities or options related to or supported by it for the duration of the Subplot. Thereafter, he receives his new Alignment’s ritual weapon.</p><p>If Subplots are not part of your game, the character instead permanently loses access to the Interest slot, as well as his current Paths, skills, avatar, class abilities, feat abilities, and other character options requiring or supporting an Alignment. He must devote a new Interest slot to an Alignment to gain access to its options. He may re-allocate Steps at that time as well, along Paths associated with his new Alignment.</p><h3>HOW DO MIRACLES IMPACT SOCIETY?</h3><p>When belief has a palpable impact on the world, the world tends to sit up and take notice. Supernatural manifestations, especially those clearly prompted by a higher power, have a profound influence on society. They bring people together (in religious groups, governments, or civilizations) and tear them apart (particularly when miracles come from opposed Alignments). They beget champions to spread the word and smite infidels, and forge resentful enemies even when there’s no clear benefit in opposing the faith. Sadly, they also spark bloody, bitter wars beyond imagination.</p><p>All these things can and do happen without true miracles, which is all the more reason to seriously consider the reactions of a society faced with genuine power beyond their control — and perhaps beyond their understanding. What do worshippers hope to gain from their Alignments and how do they use them in everyday life? How do religious factions leverage their followers’ power and how do governments and other groups respond?</p><p>If your game features Priests and Paladins, are they trained by and/or answer to one or more religious factions? Whether they do or not, what’s their role in society? Are they soldiers, activists, saviors, or all three? Are their services available to the masses or restricted to the elite? What special allowances and indulgences do they enjoy? How heavily do others rely on them to survive and/or thrive?</p><p>Widely accepted miracles can prompt all these questions and many more. Rare, if not unknown, is the world that witnesses such power without fundamental change.</p><blockquote><h3>THE FLAVOR OF MIRACLES AND MAGIC</h3><p>When miracles and magic are real, your choices don’t end with their impact on society. You can also decide how these incredible powers look, sound, and feel, both to observers and those invoking them. Is every miracle accompanied by a sense of euphoria? Does every arcane spell make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up? You can go without this extra description, of course, but where’s the fun in that? </p><p>Adding flavor is simple: think in terms of the five senses and choose key visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory cues as desired. One or two for each (miracles and magic) is plenty unless you’re really inspired. Cues can also be set for individual abilities and spells, or groups, but to avoid information overload you should probably reserve that option for effects important to the plot. This option’s handy when you want to spark a player realization with narration (e.g. “The room floods with the smell of sulfur.”).</p></blockquote>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"PATHS","type":"text","_id":"66YXc0BMl0rfI3Lq","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Alignments are often complex and multidimensional, with many facets expressing their personality or influence, or that of the power behind them. For example, the indifferent Cimmerian god Crom is patron of strength, martial prowess, and craftsmanship, while the culture’s evil god Set grants his followers magical skill, great and mysterious secrets, and hypnotic attractiveness. In Fantasy Craft, these facets are represented by “Paths,” spheres of influence that may be tapped by an Alignment’s followers when the miracles quality is applied.</p><p>There are five Steps along each Path, each granting one or more miraculous abilities and/or spells. A single Alignment can feature two to five Paths and each time a character with that Alignment is permitted to take a Step, he may take it along any one his Alignment’s Paths.</p><p><em>Example: </em>Fallow, a Priest, is Aligned to the dwarf god Degmos (see page 309), which grants him access to the Earth, Metal, and Strength Paths. At Level 1, Fallow’s acolyte ability lets him take a Step along one of his Paths. He chooses Metal I, which grants him the Crafting (Metalworking) focus and a +5 bonus with Crafting (Metalworking) checks. Two class levels later, path of the devoted lets Fallow take another Step. He chooses Strength I, which grants him a +5 bonus with Athletics checks. After another two class levels, Fallow may gain Earth I, Metal II, or Strength II (but only one of those three).</p><h2>CASTING PATH SPELLS</h2><p><br />When a character casts a spell granted by a Path, he’s considered a divine caster (see page 110).</p><h3>PATH OF AIR</h3><p><strong>Air I: </strong>You gain Bang and Electrical Resistance equal to 3 times your Air Step. <br /><strong>Air II: </strong>You may convert damage inflicted by your melee and unarmed attacks to electrical damage.

In the Arthurian legends and the Lord of the Rings trilogy spells are cast only by a select few (any of whom may be NPCs, depending on how the material is adapted). Other possible inspirations, like the Gormenghast and Kushiel novels, feature no spellcasting at all.</p><p>If spellcasting is possible, apply the sorcery campaign quality (see page 325). Then ask yourself two questions. The answer to one or both should be yes.</p><p>• Can characters cast spells? If so, then you should allow one or more arcane caster classes (in this book, the Mage and perhaps the Alchemist and/or Rune Knight).</p><p>• Can NPCs cast spells? If so, then apply the Spellcasting Signature Skill as desired (see page 228).</p><p>If only one may cast spells, develop a reason why. Maybe spellcasting is restricted to an elite class (all of whom are player or other special characters). On the flip side, spellcasting might be the exclusive province of diabolists (NPCs) who are encroaching upon a civilized, non-magic society (the PCs’ home). </p><p>You can also limit spellcasting in your world by excluding any spells you think will be problematic. Note that this has a ripple effect across the system, eliminating certain gear (especially scrolls and elixirs), and potentially certain character options as well (including certain Path Steps).</p><p>If people can cast in your setting, you should also define how spells are acquired. It can be as simple as new formulae “dawning” on casters as they grow in power, it can involve complex and specific quests, or the process may be unique to your world.</p><h3>HOW DOES SPELLCASTING IMPACT SOCIETY?</h3><p>The ability to bend reality to one’s will is monumental, touching every corner of civilization, from civic life and health to business and war. Imagine a world where magical healing rendered medicine, and perhaps even natural healing, obsolete… Where effective long-range scrying dominated espionage without risking a single life… Where a thriving golem industry eliminated the need for common labor? None of these worlds would, or could, progress as we expect. All of them would revolve in some way around magic.</p><p>The effects of spellcasting don’t have to be this widespread but to make this happen you need to think about the nature and limitations of magic. Is it an omnipresent power understood by everyone or an elusive secret protected by a guarded cabal? Is it easily mastered or an exacting specialty trained by a select few? Is it safe and painless or fraught with peril and woe? The second answer to each of these questions can help curb the sweeping impact of spellcasting and simultaneously give magic some character in your world.</p><p>These questions may naturally lead you to define the origins of magic, which can also help structure additional limitations. Spells won’t change the world quite as much if every casting destroys valuable components, or drains the life forces of those in the vicinity (perhaps even the caster), or weakens the veil between your world and… another (presumably more dangerous) place.</p><p>With the origin, nature, and limitations of spellcasting in hand, you can start to ask the tough questions. Who casts spells and why? Are spells tools of war, commerce, healing, transport, theft, all of these things, or something else entirely? Who employs casters and toward what end? Do groups or governments support, protect, capture, or eradicate spellcasters? When, how, and why are they trained? How are they viewed by the general populace in each region? Try to imagine what living in your world must be like given your vision of magic, and expand from there.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"WHAT SPECIES EXIST IN YOUR GAME?","type":"text","_id":"N2Trp4NO48KIaWPy","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>With all the metaphysical questions answered for your world, it’s time to sprinkle mortals across the land! There are two things to consider here: heroic species and monsters.</p><h3>WHAT ARE YOUR HEROIC SPECIES?</h3><p>By default, Fantasy Craft features twelve heroic (playable) species: drakes, dwarves, elves, giants, goblins, humans, ogres, orcs, pech, rootwalkers, saurians, and unborn. This assumes an extremely diverse high fantasy setting, which may not be to your liking. Feel free to prohibit any of these, making them monsters (see next) or excluding them altogether. </p><p>Next, take a moment to personalize each of your heroic species. In your world, do their appearances vary from the Origin descriptions? Do they have an unusual history? How commonly are they seen? Do they have population centers (cities, towns, or villages) or live in the wild? Do they have common characteristics, personality traits, or quirks? Do they speak a unique language? Do they specialize in anything or have any cultural weaknesses? Do they favor or eschew certain weapons, gear, or tactics?</p><p>After you’ve run Fantasy Craft a couple times and you’re comfortable with the rules, you might also want to consider which splinter races are available in your world and how they interact with the root species and each other. The easiest way to do this is to look through the Species feats (see page 99), identifying which you want to disallow and/or make monsters, and answering important questions for those available to the players.</p><h3>WHICH MONSTERS EXIST?</h3><p>The Bestiary in Chapter 6 includes over 70 unique monster types and many more individual monsters and template combinations. This dizzying menagerie can easily populate hundreds of unique fantasy worlds or overrun a single high fantasy setting. It isn’t necessary to decide whether each and every one is part of your game right off the bat — and in fact, it’s counterproductive.</p><p>Instead, ask whether any are iconic adversaries. It’s generally a good idea to start with at least three to five monsters the characters can immediately identify as “the enemy.” Remember that heroic species can also be monsters, whether they’re disallowed to player characters or not.</p><p>You don’t need to answer nearly as many questions about monsters, nor do you have to go into as much detail. Unless you’d like to change something, you can keep it as simple as a list of iconics and maybe another for those you’re sure will never appear.</p><h3>CHANGING THE RULES</h3><p>Fantasy Craft’s heroic species and monsters are based on commonly accepted concepts (with a few interesting twists to keep things interesting and “kick it up a notch”). However, you’re in no way obliged to include them as is, and making a few changes is a great way to add a bit of extra personality to your setting. Perhaps in your world only elves have the gift of magic. Maybe dwarves can’t ride mounts. Brain fiends might be mute and drakes might be wingless (flying magically, mechanically, or not at all).</p><p>Many adjustments to heroic species are simple: swapping out attribute modifiers and bonus feats, for example. You can also restrict base and expert classes, Specialties, and even feats to or from a species, and apply the banned action quality to keep certain skills or combat activities out of a species’ hands. There’s a careful balance in play throughout the system but a few minor tweaks here and there aren’t going to break anything. If you’re really worried, visit the Crafty Games forum (www.craftygames. com), where new rules are constantly being devised, reviewed, and tested.</p><p>Monster adjustments are even easier and perfectly balanced at all times — simply add, remove, or swap the abilities you want and modify the XP value accordingly!</p><h3>STIRRING THE MELTING POT</h3><p>Finally, take a look at your heroic species and monsters and think about how they interact. Is the world basically civilized with pockets of monsters or overrun by creatures surrounding a few beleaguered points of light? Which species and/or monsters trade with each other and how (e.g. across established naval channels, with informal merchant caravans, or maybe through a thriving black market)? Are any species allied or at war with others? Is interspecies sex and/or marriage common or taboo? Is there racial or ethnic prejudice and if so, is it merely chilly (like the old grudges between dwarves and elves in The Lord of the Rings) or violent (akin to the savage wars between dwarves and goblins in the mines of Moria)?</p><p>Are any species dominant, controlling the majority of the land, law, or currency? This is especially telling: a world overrun by orc hordes is probably a gruesome, warlike place where only the strong survive, while one shared in roughly equal number by exotic species may see relatively little racial tension, as well as vastly diverse nations and cultures.</p><p>If your world has a bit of history and you’d like to shake things up, consider how insular each species is and whether it’s picked up traits from other cultures. The classic perception, for instance, is that elves live in forest glades and universally rise above or ignore the eccentricities of other species, retaining an unswerving focus on nature, beauty, and order despite thousands of years of inter-species relations. Likewise, dwarves are often portrayed with a single face — that of surly mountain-, cave-, and gem-loving hermits unfazed by visitors and neighbors. How much more interesting would it be if centuries of negotiations between these two cultures had rubbed off on individuals and groups, merging elements of their cultural and ethnic identities — if they’d started to share religions, language, art, gear and technologies, crafting techniques, naming trends, proverbs, and a thousand other things?</p><p>This “realistic” approach isn’t easy, as isolated tweaks can seem out of place in an otherwise undisturbed world, especially if they lack plausible ramifications. Following just a few fundamental influences through to their natural conclusion can bring a world to life, however, creating rich opportunities for roleplay.</p><p>No matter how you stir the melting pot, be sure to include ways for player characters of all the allowed heroic species to adventure together. Most mature players can get past a bit of mild species bias, and to a few it’s a roleplaying gold mine, but nothing good can come of outright, universal rancor between characters. It’s a license for the childish and impudent to act out, and a recipe for disaster in a gaming group.</p><h2>NATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS</h2><p>In traditional fantasy gaming, the heroes are usually a little like cowboys, wandering swordsmen and shiftless do-gooders who stumble from one adventure to the next in a quest for personal glory and/or fabulous wealth, bound only by loyalty to one another. Conversely, heroes of legend, mythology, and literary fiction often serve the greater good (or evil), becoming champions of a desperate kingdom, errant knights sent to recover a precious relic stolen from their masters, or a fellowship sent by free people to destroy an artifact of ultimate evil.</p><p>Even if the heroes (and players) in your game defy authority, refusing “missions” without something in return, nations and organizations can be powerful storytelling forces and in your game. They can establish laws, put on festivals and other events, employ NPCs, and drive the plot forward as supporters or adversaries. One of the most common fantasy organizations, the guild, is a bottomless well of play potential, sometimes rivaling or exceeding the local city government in power and scope. Guildmasters are often portrayed as the crime kingpins of the fantasy world but they can just as easily become benevolent campaigners for just causes.</p><p>In many ways, nations and organizations fill the same game role as deities. Their actions shift the setting, establishing background and creating situations against which the party’s adventures unfold. Though the characters might sometimes get involved directly, such moments should be rare and meaningful. The day the party is arrested for a crime, whether they committed it or not, is an excellent opportunity to showcase the local government, and a corrupt guild might make a great ultimate threat for an ongoing political campaign.</p><p>When building the nations and organizations in your world, focus initially on the few that matter most in the game you want to play. Size and scope aren’t as important as their role in your game. It isn’t helpful to develop all the nations on the planet if your characters will never get out of a single valley, for instance, but if the local merchant caravans all pay a chunk of their profits to a connected mogul who commands a small army, that’s relevant — and a great source of story.</p><p>All the choices you’ve made thus far should help here. You aren’t likely to see a globe-spanning empire in an ancient setting, for example, because the infrastructure needed to communicate with and transport to remote regions is missing. Conversely, a world of lost gods and powerful magic might naturally suggest underground cults of religious zealots or clans of despotic mage-kings (perhaps both, leading to a war for divine truth). If unborn are the dominant species, any government you build is likely to be sterile and mechanical, which may lead you to install one or two upstart organizations for the “lesser” organic species.</p><h3>IN HIS MAJESTY’S SERVICE</h3><p>In Fantasy Craft, a character’s social standing is represented by his Reputation, or more accurately his Renown. This statistic grants a character the ability to keep Prizes and request Favors (see page 187), but it also awards him titles by which he’s known in your world. These titles are one of the strongest ways to personalize your setting, immediately establishing a vernacular for the commonly accepted pecking order. If you wanted, you could even create honorifics unique to one or more nations or organizations.</p><p>You can also customize Renown by restricting benefits to characters belonging to certain nations and organizations. For example, it follows that a knight of the king’s court with a high Military Renown should be able to spend Reputation for holdings (fiefdoms awarded by his lord for brave service) and Favors (conferred by his title). He might not be able to keep magic items, however, bound by a pledge to return them to the royal museum or local armory.</p><p>Another example might find a master thief loved by the people due to a high Heroic Renown, which grants him the option to keep magic items and purchase Contacts (though his guild), but denying him holdings (which are deemed too risky by his guildmaster). </p><p>A high-ranking cardinal in the royal church, flush with Noble Renown, might enjoy all the Renown benefits thanks to the church’s far-reaching hand, immense wealth, and bountiful political influence. This might compensate for other difficulties he faces in your world, such as fewer class options (or even a mandated class progression).</p><h2>WAY OF LIFE </h2><p>It’s easy to gloss over the lives of everyday people in an RPG (“they wear poor clothes, eat broth, and look downtrodden”), but this squanders a great opportunity to give your world that extra spark of personality and just as importantly, to establish a framework for the questions to follow.</p><p>Again, your previous decisions offer many initial hooks: era defines trade and available technologies; Alignment informs common moral codes and beliefs, and possibly how fearful and/or pious the people are; the commonality of magic might suggest the populace’s reliance on supernatural assistance and/or popular opinion about spellcasters; every species contributes to the lifestyles of the others and the melting pot — or lack thereof — can tell you how xenophobic or tolerant people are; and the states and groups you’ve developed may hint at how citizens relate to authority. Naturally this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg but it’s a great base and offers you plenty of starting detail.</p><h3>CLASS AND CASTE</h3><p>Most societies feature class systems, where people are born and grow up in one class but have the opportunity, however slim, to improve (or worsen) their lives. A few have caste systems, establishing social standing at birth, with no chance of enrichment. As a rule, caste systems are more common in early eras and class systems become more pronounced in later ones. Many primitive fantasy settings determine standing by age while feudal settings tend to divide by social or economic role (nobles at the top, followed by knights, merchants, and peasants at the bottom). Any, all, or none of this may be true in your world, however.</p><p>Start with the basic question (class or caste system?) and expand from there. Is standing dictated by birth, sex, wealth, race, religious orientation, ownership, merit, or other factors? How important is one’s class to other parts of society? How do members of different social strata relate? Is everyone treated equally under the law or does hierarchy override justice? Do heroes rise from all strata or only certain segments of society? In a class system, what’s required to promote oneself or take a tumble down the social ladder?</p><p>Mechanically, ask whether the social system in your world limits a character’s Reputation. In a feudal fantasy game, for example, only nobles and knights might earn full Reputation from adventures; merchants might only earn half and peasants none at all. Characters might only be able to earn so much Reputation (e.g. peasants “capping out” at 0 and merchants capping out at 100), or they might have limited access to Favors (e.g. none costing more than 20 Reputation for merchants). As in the previous section, a character’s class or caste might restrict him from certain Reputation purchases altogether, and it certainly has an impact on the titles he can hold.</p><h3>EVERYDAY LIVING</h3><p>For all these large-scale social questions, fortunately, there are also simple ones. Consider the daily lives of the classes or castes the characters likely hail from and those they’ll likely interact with (adventures often draw parties into the lowest social tiers, though it depends on the story). In these circles, what do people eat, drink, and wear? Are they generally literate and/or educated? Are they mostly upbeat or gloomy? What do they do for fun? Are they social or do they keep to themselves? What jobs do they take (and realistically desire)? What’s their daily routine? These details may seem trivial but they can have tremendous impact when describing and roleplaying scenes. As usual, you don’t want to overload the players with detail but ignoring the little flourishes can sabotage even the most intriguing world concept.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"TRADE AND CURRENCY","type":"text","_id":"suLDoHhQ4rJThT2b","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>All civilized societies engage in trade, exchanging valuable commodities, goods, and services. In Fantasy Craft, all trade, no matter what’s being exchanged, is measured with a “silver standard.” Currency can take the form of actual coin (made of silver and/or other materials) or anything else that fits your world: valuable ingots, spices, raw materials, beads, future services…</p><p>You’re fine even if you don’t use actual silver pieces — just measure each unit of your world’s currency against the silver values in Chapter 4. It’s easiest if you have an analog for a single silver piece (e.g. 1 bead-stone equals 1s), but you’ll be fine as long as the silver conversion is simple (e.g. 1 iron ingot equals 15s).</p><p>When deciding on your currency, consider what’s scarce, valuable, or prized in your world. A primitive society that has no use for shiny rocks might cherish fine pelts for clothing or spices to preserve food for the winter. Likewise, the coins of different nations might have different values across the land, based on perceived strength, stockpiles of precious items, and outright bias (indeed, some nations may refuse their enemies’ currencies).</p><p>Though far from necessary, you might also want to consider the breadth of trade across your world. Is it strictly local or does it span continents? Does it cross seas? What trade goods are highly sought? Is any nation or region the exclusive source of a treasured resource? Answering these questions prepares you to present your world’s markets with confidence and style.</p><h2>GEAR</h2><p>Chapter 4 offers a huge selection of gear, available by era and based on real world technological growth to prevent anything from going dramatically “wrong” with an out-of-thebox campaign. As the GM, you have the right and responsibility to tailor this selection to fit your world, based on the specific advancements made, the edicts of leaders, your group’s preferences, and as always, the needs of your story.</p><h3>RESTRICTING GEAR</h3><p>By default, all gear in Chapter 4 is available on the open market, but you have two options for restricting items, individually or in groups.</p><p>• Make the gear so rare it never appears on the market. This option preserves your right to introduce the restricted item as an adventure reward (see page 344).</p><p>• Make the gear non-existent in your world. This option’s best reserved for items you know will disrupt or derail the flow of play.</p><p>One of the most common gear issues involves black powder weapons. You might decide that there’s no place in your world for longarms, for example, but retain sidearms as a specialty item crafted by a select few smiths. This keeps troublesome weapons out of the characters’ hands and also gives them a reason to invest in the Crafting skill themselves (assuming they don’t want to make friends with a smith or perhaps acquire one as a Contact).</p><p>Scrolls and elixirs can also be problematic, though they’re automatically limited if you exclude any spells from your world (see page 314). You can also specifically remove them, though in the case of scrolls it’s probably best to remove all scrolls or none (as they’re all made in much the same fashion). With elixirs you have a little more room for discretion, as you can explain their absence with unavailable components (making them rare or non-existent in your world, just like any undesired gear).</p><p>Magic items are a huge sticking point for some. The big question is whether characters can buy them with Reputation (see page 194). This should only be allowed in high magic games where items are so readily available that an economy can plausibly develop around them. For ways to control the frequency and power of magic items, consider the flexible magic items, greater magic items, monty haul, plentiful magic items, and/or rare magic items campaign qualities (see page 322).</p><p>Also keep in mind that removing any gear — magic or otherwise — may require re-rolls on the treasure tables and/or cause complications for certain classes (like the Alchemist if all elixirs are removed).</p><p>Always inform the players of what’s not available, though you can withhold whether an item is permanently out of play or just held in reserve (there’s no need to ruin the surprise when and if the party finds one, and keeping this decision to yourself also lets you change your mind if you later need to introduce a “nonexistent” item).</p><h3>MIXING ERAS</h3><p>Fantasy is, well, fantastic — which can account for many deviations from true history. There’s no reason your world can’t include anachronistic gear, so long as it’s plausible enough to your group. Advanced technology can be made available worldwide (e.g. rapiers across a feudal setting or metal swords throughout a primitive one), or you can limit them to certain cultures (e.g. primitive tribal orcs alongside feudal elves and industrial dwarves) or regions (an ancient culture on one continent and primitive ones everywhere else).</p><p>When fiddling with technology, avoid making too much work for yourself. If you change more than about 3 categories of gear, you might want to consider advancing the era instead. The last thing you want to do is create a baseline your group can’t easily grasp in play.</p><h3>RESTRICTING CRAFTING</h3><p>The final decision you may need to make about gear is what characters can craft versus what “professional” crafters can make. This is important because Crafting can become an easy way to circumvent gear restrictions. Allowing characters to make black powder weapons that have been restricted to adventure rewards, for example, defeats the purpose; likewise letting them make scrolls if none exist in the world. Be sure to inform players of the restriction or absence of certain crafting options so they can make character-building choices with confidence.</p><h3>WORKSHOPS</h3><p>Most heroes don’t have ready access to their own workshops (see page 159) but may be able to find them in town or build them into their holdings (see page 193). Given the benefits of Crafting in a workshop, it’s likely they’ll become vital in a game where any of the characters use the skill. Thus it’s important for you to establish the minimum size population center that has a workshop and the average cost of using it (in silver pieces by the day). If you’d like to make things simple, this cost can be deducted from the Crafting check result.</p><p>Certain types of workshops may not appear in certain parts of the world (where vital raw materials are missing, for example, or where the resulting items are in low demand). Some may be restricted to certain species, classes or castes, or organizations. Some may have a premium price (perhaps even costing Reputation instead of silver).</p><h2>LANGUAGES AND STUDIES</h2><p>Characters may or may not spend one Interest to take an Alignment but the rest go to languages spoken and fields studied, which are another great opportunity to flesh out your world.</p><p>Languages can develop within nearly any significant group. They’re most common among cultures but species, nations, organizations, and even Alignments can have their own tongues (e.g. the black and twisted words spoken between followers of a dark god). Niche languages are prevalent among groups that trade, militaries using signals to convey orders, and secretive factions speaking in code (e.g. thieves’ guilds). Keep languages simple and relevant: a list of up to 10 languages across your entire setting is plenty unless you’re running a complex multinational, multi-species epic. Also, avoid defining languages too narrowly — it may seem flavorful to give infernal bugbears their own tongue but unless they’re routinely encountered the chance of a player investing an Interest in it is pretty slim.</p><p>Studies, on the other hand, can literally be anything — a character could follow regional gambling or the tales of a particular mythology, cook in a certain style or debate a particular philosophical outlook. Rather than defining what studies are possible, it’s better to come up with a list of the most common and useful studies that heroes might take. This is one of the most-open ended ways to establish world flavor (i.e. “Worship of Hashur, Lord of the West” rather than “religion” or “Sips of the Fang Rock Strangle Plums” rather than “wines”). This can ground your players a bit and provide a ready list of interesting story and plot hooks.</p><h2>THE CALENDAR</h2><p>Measuring time is often overlooked in setting design but it’s yet another powerful tool in your world-building toolbox. For instance, on a world close to the sun, “winter” may just be slightly cooler than summer, having little if nothing to do with snow. A world with multiple moons may mark the change of seasons with regular eclipses or lunar convergences. Another world might measure years in 10-day weeks and 5-week months.</p><p>One of the most flavorful elements of building your calendar isn’t in its justification but in the names people have for years, months, weeks, and days (or whatever increments you wind up using). A swamp world once ruled by fierce flightless dragons might use a general term for years (“molts,” after the amount of time a dragon is believed to have kept his skin), but name months after the most ancient dragons (who might also be gods in the setting) and weeks after saurian heroes throughout time. Days might be named for the scale tones of the four major saurian splinter races in the world, and a cornerstone of their ongoing political stability (each splinter race retaining a favorable negotiating position on its day).</p><p>You might also want to think about significant social, political, or magical events throughout your year — what they mean to the people, how they’re observed, and what they’re called. For example, the greatest feast of the year may be held on the solstice, bringing society to a halt for the revelry. Ley lines that fuel sorcerous magic might only flare at the new year, reserving the most powerful spells for that day alone.</p><h2>CRIMES AND PUNISHMENT</h2><p>Laws in fantasy worlds can be fluid, even progressive policies maintained by small collectives, but more often they’re staid edicts laid down by gods, philosopher-kings, or leaders of old. They can be brazenly prejudiced, favoring certain species, social classes, and religions over others, or surprisingly egalitarian, exhibiting fairness in court that’s rarely seen elsewhere. In a well conceived system they can also incorporate willful supernatural acts, like spells and reliable miracles, establishing whether it’s lawful to raise the dead against their will, or secretly scrye on others, study or practice certain magical Schools and Disciplines, or pursue certain Alignments.</p><p>Something else to consider is the government’s involvement in keeping the peace. Are enforcers numerous and omnipresent or few and far between? Are they dogged and unwavering or passive and forgiving? Do they forgive certain crimes but not others? Do any of them take the law into their own hands, dispensing justice on their terms? Is this, in fact, expected (perhaps because courts don’t exist in the land, or are only used when a criminal requests a trial)? When trials happen, what’s the process? Where do they occur and who passes judgment on the accused? Are the courts receptive to bribes? When someone is found guilty, where are they punished? Is their punishment a private affair or a public spectacle?</p><h3>LAYING DOWN THE LAW</h3><p>Parties run afoul of the law, even when they’re trying not to — it’s a frequent byproduct of RPG adventuring — so it’s helpful to identify crimes in your world and the punishment(s) typically inflicted for each. Common crimes and punishments are found on Table 7.2: Trials (see below). Some or all of these may not apply and you can and should introduce more as appropriate. For example, assault and murder may not be crimes in a hardened sword and sorcery world, while possession of certain sacred fruits by anyone but a shaman might be grounds for flogging.</p><p>If trials occur, you should also establish the crime’s severity in the eyes of the court (minor or major).</p><table style=\"text-align:left\"><tbody><tr><th>Crime</th><th>Successes Required</th></tr><tr><td>Adultery</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Arson</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Assault</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Bearing false witness</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Blasphemy</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Desecration of a sacred place</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Fraud</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Heresy</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Indecency</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Kidnapping</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Murder</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Prostitution</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Rape</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Theft</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Treason</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Trespassing</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Using forbidden magic</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Vandalism</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Severity/DC</th><th>Sample Punishments</th></tr><tr><td>Minor (DC 15)</td><td>Imprisonment (1d6 weeks); flogging (2d6 wound damage); 1d6×100s fine; banishment</td></tr><tr><td>Major (DC 20)</td><td>Imprisonment (2d6 months); branding (–1 Appearance modifier); maiming (–1 to physical attribute); execution</td></tr><tr><th>Court</th><th>Additional Tries</th></tr><tr><td>Kangaroo</td><td>–1 (at least one critical success is needed to escape punishment!)</td></tr><tr><td>Hostile</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Antagonistic</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Neutral</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Amiable</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly</td><td>+4</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Bribing the Court:</strong> This dangerous option can easily backfire if the court isn’t receptive. When a character offers incentives for preferential treatment and the GM hasn’t already determined whether the court is receptive to bribes, the GM should roll 1d6: a result of 1–2 means the court resents the attempt, reducing the character’s additional tries by 1, while a result of 5–6 means the court is receptive, increasing his additional tries by 1. A result of 3–4 indicates a principled or unfazed court, with no modifier to additional tries.</p><h3>TRIALS</h3><p>In a particularly enlightened world, every character accused of a crime may stand trial, though in most fantasy settings a trial must be requested, if the option is available at all. Mechanically, a trial is a Complex Task using information from Table 7.2 (see below).</p><p><strong>Crime:</strong> The worst crime for which the defendant is on trial determines the number of successful skill checks the defendant must make to win the Task and escape punishment.</p><p><strong>Crime’s Severity:</strong> The crime’s severity determines the DC of each check during the Task. When a minor crime is heinous in nature, you may arbitrarily upgrade it to major.</p><p><strong>Court’s Demeanor:</strong> The court’s demeanor determines the number of Challenges available to the defendant in relation to the number of necessary successes.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil is caught raiding an ancient king’s tomb. In his world theft is typically a minor crime but as the king was especially well loved the GM upgrades the severity to major, setting a DC of 20 for all Challenges. Not having a pre-established court in place, the GM decides on the fly that it consists of antagonistic nobles who don’t take kindly to “commoners” defiling their grave sites. This means poor Brungil has to succeed with 3 (for theft) out of 4 Challenges (for the antagonistic court), each with a DC of 20, to escape punishment.</p><p>A character may attempt each Challenge with one of the following skills: Bluff (lie to the court), Haggle (plead or trade information for leniency), Impress (play on the court’s sympathies), Intimidate (harass a witness or bully the court), or Investigate (offer evidence). He may use each skill no more than twice during the Task and never twice in a row. A character using a legal advocate gains a morale bonus with each check (see page 169).</p><p>If the character wins the Task he avoids punishment; otherwise, he suffers the punishment commonly inflicted for the crime in your world. If no punishment is established, you choose one based on the crime’s severity, as shown on Table 7.2.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil’s trial begins. For the first Challenge, he decides to throw himself on the mercy of the court, using his Impress skill and scoring a success. He can’t use that tactic in the second Challenge, so he tries to Bluff the court instead. He isn’t a terribly good liar, though, and fails. Brungil falls back on his Impress skill for the third Challenge and succeeds again. The fourth Challenge is do or die, so Brungil takes a risk and argues for a lack of evidence using his Investigate skill….</p><p>Unfortunately, he fails this last Challenge as well, so he’s found guilty. Normally, the punishment for theft on Brungil’s world is a 1d6 × 100s fine but as the GM decided this particular theft was a major crime he also has to choose a punishment. He sends Brungil to prison for 2d6 months. Looks like he’ll have some Downtime on his hands until someone breaks him out…</p><p>As with any Complex Task, a trial can benefit from roleplay, especially when the verdict marks a turning point in the game. You could run every minute but it’s far easier to highlight the important bits. Before rolling for each Challenge, let the defendant present one part of his argument — preferably the part most relevant to the skill being used — and apply a discretionary modifier based on the argument’s strength and his delivery in the eyes of the court. To include everyone, let the other players take the roles of spectators, awarding action dice to those who make the experience more thrilling and fun for everyone. If the spectator commentary is plausible for the world you can even use it to help determine your discretionary modifiers for each Challenge.</p><h2>HISTORY</h2><p>Just as our world’s events are an outgrowth of its people, cultures, and way of life, so can your fantasy world’s history come from all the decisions you’ve made about thus far. Determining some critical turning point events can help develop a spine for other the details of your world, as well as the story of your game. As an example, turning points in The Lord of the Rings include the arrival of the Men of the West, the forging of the rings of power, and the ends of the Ages (not to mention the wars fought along the way). These events shaped the world that Frodo and his companions found themselves in, as well as their adventures through the books.</p><p>Turning points should be significant, if not world-changing. Major wars, cataclysmic environmental changes, widespread plagues, the arrival of new species, and the rise and fall of empires are all good examples, though in a narrowly focused fantasy world even the death of a parent, the loss of a family relic, or the start of a feud might qualify. When outlining turning points, focus on the big picture — what happened, who was involved or affected, how the event resolved, and who benefited from it (if anyone). If a turning point is recent, you might also ask if any instigator(s) still live and if the event is still happening (and if so, who can use it to their advantage).</p><h2>GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE</h2><p>These factors can be as instrumental in defining flavor, inhabitants, cultures, and story as any event or god. A world covered almost entirely by water naturally develops primarily amphibious and aquatic species, a strong sea trade, and navies over armies. Conversely, a desert world may consider water more precious than gold (perhaps even using it as currency), build with sand and brick instead of wood and plant matter, and keep a nocturnal schedule to avoid the blazing heat. A continent crisscrossed with treacherous mountain ranges might host cultures that have never seen or heard of each other, each with its own unique era of technological and cultural development.</p><p>When physically building a world, your first instinct might be to start with terrain and weather, laying cultures and history over it, but the opposite approach works just as well. To include a few nations, cultures, and species that share languages and defend one another’s borders, make them neighbors and adapt the terrain to justify their growth in those locations. If you’d like two groups to constantly be at odds, place them both close to a valuable natural resource (such as a deep water port) and develop reasons neither of them can permanently capture it (such as powerful storms which ravage the port and smash occupying navies). Build impassable geographic barriers to funnel the party through dangerous areas during an important adventure, introduce periodic volcanoes and/or earthquakes to upset potentially stagnant areas, and use intermittent but disastrous weather to isolate regions or force the party to rely on fewer resources.</p><h3>THE WORLD MAP</h3><p>A visual map is a valuable tool for sharing your vision and making sure everyone understands where they are and what’s around them — but there are many potential pitfalls. First, be sure to keep your map’s scale practical. While it’s commendable to map four full continents and thousands of square miles of land, it’s pointless unless the players are going to travel all the way around the world. Start with what’s immediately relevant to your story and let the map develop organically as need and inspiration demand.</p><p>Likewise, you can keep the geography beyond the party’s starting surroundings vague, at least at first. Highlight important features — continents, oceans, mountain ranges, deserts, rough climates, and well-known landmarks — and add detail as the adventure moves into new regions. Undiscovered countries are wonderful sources of inspiration when a game gets stale, and they’re just as exciting for the party to discover.</p><p>Note any important geopolitical borders, particularly as they relate to the story you intend to tell, and show locations important to the party: national capitals, major cities and towns, ports of call, the headquarters of any groups they know, the homes of their Contacts, and the last known positions of enemies. The occasional flourish usually won’t hurt — “Here There Be Monsters” — but be careful not to make them too interesting or the party may ignore the plot to investigate.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"CAMPAIGN QUALITIES","type":"text","_id":"yLULPOvzlF0b8z4f","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>No two fantasy worlds are the same — some are dominated by evil powers, others feature wild and terrible magic, and still others feature god-forsaken populations living and dying in brutal strife. The default Fantasy Craft rules are perfect for most fantasy gaming “out of the box” but when you’re looking for something a little different, or if your world diverges from traditional fantasy gaming, consider adding campaign qualities. These optional rules alter the system in small or dramatic ways to fit your world and vision. Everything from character creation to combat to magic and Alignment can be tweaked, granting absolute control over your game.</p><p>Campaign qualities can be used in two ways — as permanent effects or as temporary conditions. Permanent campaign qualities are active for the duration of your game but you can add temporary campaign qualities to an adventure at any time by spending one or more action dice (see page 365). Temporary campaign qualities last until the end of the current scene, making them a great way to represent fleeting effects, dramatic episodes, and other exciting moments.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Kevin is running a Fantasy Craft game and reaches the final climactic encounter. Wanting it to be a little more dangerous, he spends 3 action dice to add the deadly combat quality. The threat ranges of attacks increase by 2 for the rest of the scene. The party won’t soon forget this encounter!</p><p>Some campaign qualities, like miracles and sorcery, are labeled “Permanent” and may not be activated using action dice. These qualities have fundamental or lasting impacts on the game and make no sense over just a scene. Both miracles and sorcery may be tailored in various ways, some of which may be triggered like temporary campaign qualities.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Kevin starts another game in a world of his own creation. Spellcasting is possible, so he adds the permanent sorcery quality, but he also wants it to periodically become uncontrollable. Fortunately, this is easily handled with strategic, temporary application of the wild magic quality. Alternately, he could add wild magic as a permanent quality, keeping arcane casters on their toes at all times.</p><p>Initially, you should probably add no more than 3 permanent qualities to each game and 1 temporary quality to each scene. More than that and it might get hard for players to keep track of the optional rules. As you gain more experience, you could go as high as 5–7 permanent qualities per game and 2–3 temporary qualities per scene, though his is pretty ambitious and requires a great memory and strong understanding of the core rules. As with any mechanical changes, less is often more.</p><h4>ADVENTURE INSURANCE (PERMANENT)</h4><p>People respect the stout of heart, even when fate doesn’t. If a hero loses a Prize while being heroic or through no fault of his own (e.g. drops a magic sword into a chasm to catch a falling teammate, suffers the accidental death of a Contact, etc.), he immediately regains 1/2 the Prize’s Reputation value (rounded down). This “rebate” is granted at the GM’s sole discretion and should not apply when a hero deliberately gives up a Prize without a heroic reason, or when he loses a Prize for callous or greedy reasons (e.g. knowingly puts a Contact at risk, trades a magic item for personal gain, etc.).</p><h4>BEEFY HEROES (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>A ripped physique is all the armor a real hero needs! Special characters gain Lethal and Subdual Resistance equal to their Strength modifier (min. 0).</p><h4>BLEAK HEROES (3 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>These are dark times and the odds are stacked high against heroes. Each hero’s starting action dice decrease by 2 and none of his action dice explode. Abilities based on the number of starting action dice are unaffected (i.e. they’re calculated using the hero’s normal number of starting action dice).</p><h4>BOLD HEROES (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>Heroes are larger than life and rely on luck as much as skill. Each hero’s starting action dice increase by 2 and his action dice explode with a 1 and the natural highest result (e.g. a “6” on a d6). Abilities based on the number of starting action dice are unaffected (i.e. they’re calculated using the hero’s normal number of starting action dice).</p><h4>CODE OF HONOR (2 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>The world observes one or more strict social codes or taboos of the GM’s creation (e.g. “never strike an unarmed foe,” “don’t enter the sacred faerie glades,” etc.). Each time a hero willingly violates one of these codes, he loses 2 Reputation. If this drops his Reputation below 0, the remainder becomes a debt against future awards.</p><h4>COMPLEX HEROES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Heroes are forged not only in fierce battles to save the world but also in intimate struggles of a most personal nature. The XP rewards from Subplot objectives are doubled.</p><h4>DEAD MEANS DEAD (3 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>Life is fleeting and once you check out, you don’t come back. Characters may not Cheat Death or benefit from the everlasting quality. Also, the Preparation Cost of Resurrection and other spells that return a character to life are doubled.</p><h4>DEADLY COMBAT (3 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>Combat is a life-or-death affair, with death being a very real possibility. The threat ranges of attacks increase by 2.</p><h4>DOMINANT HEROES (2 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>Carnage abounds as true heroes carve their way through lesser foes. Whenever a hero or special NPC scores a threat with an attack check, it automatically becomes a critical hit unless the attacker spends 1 action die.</p><h4>DOOMED HEROES (4 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>Threats against heroes automatically become critical hits.</p><h4>DRAMATIC PACING (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Time bends to meet the needs of the story. Durations and time restrictions lasting more than 1 hour instead last until the end of the scene (e.g. a balm that typically lasts 8 hours instead lasts the rest of the scene and a potion that may typically be used once per day may instead be used once per scene).</p><h4>FAST ATTRIBUTES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Each player character gains 1 bonus attribute point at Career Level 3 and every 3 levels thereafter. This replaces the bonus attribute points on Table 1.4: Career Level (see page 27).</p><h4>FAST FEATS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Each player character gains 1 extra feat at Career Level 2 and every 2 levels thereafter. This replaces the extra feats on Table 1.4: Career Level (see page 27).</p><h4>FAST INTERESTS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Each player character gains 1 bonus Interest at Career Level 2 and every 2 levels thereafter. This replaces the extra bonus Interests on Table 1.4: Career Level (see page 27).</p><h4>FAST LEVELS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>The XP required to gain each level decreases to 1/2 normal (rounded up), and player characters may gain up to 2 levels between adventures.</p><h4>FAST PROFICIENCIES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Each player character gains 1 bonus proficiency at Career Level 1 and at every Career Level thereafter. This replaces the bonus proficiencies on Table 1.4: Career Level (see page 27).</p><h4>FEAT EXCHANGE (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Whenever a hero gains a specific feat, or a feat from a specific tree, he may instead gain a feat from a specific tree chosen by the GM. For example, when feat exchange (Species) is applied, a character who gains a bonus feat from any other tree may choose a Species feat instead. So can a character who earns any specific feat (e.g. Combat Instincts or Polearm Basics).</p><h4>FLEXIBLE MAGIC ITEMS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Magic items are diverse and may have Charms and Essences in any combination (i.e. 2 Essences, 2 Charms, or 1 Essence and 1 Charm).</p><h4>FRAGILE HEROES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Heroes can fall as easily as lesser men. Their class vitality bonus decreases to 1/2 normal (rounded down). For example, a hero who typically has a vitality bonus of 9 instead gains only 4 vitality per level.</p><h4>GREATER MAGIC ITEMS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Magic items are especially powerful and may have up to 2 Charms and 2 Essences. Also, when randomly generating a magic item, roll twice on table 4.31 and apply both results (see page 194).</p><h4>HEARTY HEROES (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>Heroes are exceptionally resilient and bounce back quickly from injury. They benefit from natural healing even while they’re not resting, and their natural healing rate is doubled while they do rest.</p><h4>HEWN LIMBS (2 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>The world is a brutal place where no injury is trivial. Characters must save to avoid a critical injury when they suffer 16–25 points of damage in a single attack; with a failed save, the character rolls 2d20 and adds the result to his damage to determine the critical injury suffered. Also, characters must save against Massive Damage when they suffer 26 or more points of damage in a single attack (see page 208).</p><h4>IRON HEROES (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>Heroes scoff at the threat of permanent injury. Heroes must save to avoid a critical injury when they suffer 36–60 points of damage in a single attack; with a failed save, the character rolls 1d10 and adds the result to his damage to determine the critical injury suffered. Also, heroes must save against Massive Damage when they suffer 61 or more points of damage in a single attack (see page 208).</p><h4>JACKS OF ALL TRADES (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>Heroes are masters of improvisation. They never suffer untrained skill check penalties, even when they have 0 ranks or lack a required kit.</p><h4>LARGER-THAN-LIFE HEROES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Heroes stand head and shoulders above their peers. At character creation, player characters start with 40 points to buy attribute scores and may purchase scores above 18 at 5 points per score beyond 18 (i.e. a starting score of 20 costs 32 points).</p><h4>LESSER HEROES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Heroes are everyday men and women with more courage than raw ability. At character creation, player characters start with 32 points to buy attribute scores and may not start with scores above 18 (even after applying Origin benefits).</p><h4>LUCK ABOUNDS (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>Luck plays a significant role in the world. Action dice increase by 1 die type (i.e. d4s become d6s, d6s become d8s, and so on), to a maximum of d12. Also, a character may spend any number of action dice when boosting an attack check, skill check, or save.</p><h4>MIRACLES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Alignments grant fantastic powers — perhaps controlled, perhaps not (see page 309). You may tailor miracles with these additional qualities.</p><p><strong>Beneficent Universe (Permanent):</strong> The universe rewards the pious. When a character gains his first Alignment, he immediately takes the first Step along one of its Paths.</p><p><strong>Fickle Universe (2 Action Dice):</strong> The universe is temperamental, shaping the daily lives of the devoted. At the beginning of each session, roll 1d6 and consult Table 7.3: Fickle Forces (see page 325).</p><p><strong>Generous Universe (1 Action Die):</strong> The universe rewards success. Each time a character performs a service supporting his Alignment (e.g. slays a special character with an opposing Alignment or recovering an artifact of his religion), he gains two action dice.</p><p><strong>Indifferent Universe (1 Action Die):</strong> The universe ignores the faithful. Divine assistance may not be used as a justification for Narrative Control (see page 366).</p><p><strong>Strict Universe (Permanent):</strong> Characters are aligned by birth or cosmic arrangement. Every character gains an Alignment at the start of the game and may never change or lose it.</p><p><strong>Warring Universe (2 Action Dice):</strong> The universe is in turmoil and this conflict extends to the mortal realm. Every Aligned character gains an insight bonus with attack checks and opposed rolls targeting characters with an opposing Alignment equal to their Charisma modifier (min. +0).</p><p><strong>Wrathful Universe (2 Action Dice):</strong> The universe does not abide defiance. Every Aligned character is subject to a permanent Mark of Justice spell (triggered by violating his Alignment’s codes).</p><h4>MONTY HAUL (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Real heroes never leave valuable treasure behind. Player characters suffer no penalties from a heavy load and may keep twice the normal number of Prizes and any number of artifacts.</p><h4>NON-SCALING NPCS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>The world has a set pecking order and if the heroes survive long enough, they’ll eventually reach the top. Every NPC and monster’s Threat Level is set when it’s introduced and never changes. For example, the GM decides at the start of a game that all kobolds are TL 2 and all dragons are TL 14. This remains the case regardless of the PCs’ Career Levels, the adventure’s Menace, and other rules.</p><h4>PARANOIA (2 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>NPCs are exceptionally cautious, perhaps even suspicious. Disposition modifiers from skill checks and abilities decrease by 5 (min. 0) and the Persuasion DCs of Contacts increase by 10.</p><h4>PLENTIFUL MAGIC ITEMS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Magic items are especially common and impressive. The party gains a +10 bonus with Treasure Rolls on Table 7.15: Magic and may choose not to roll if directed to Table 7.11: Any, instead claiming a result of “1M.”</p><h4>RAMPANT CORRUPTION (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>Everyone has their price. Bonuses granted by incentives are doubled (see Table 2.12, page 75). Also, incentives offered to a receptive court earn the defendant 1 additional try during a trial (see page 320).</p><h4>RARE MAGIC ITEMS (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Magic items are especially uncommon (though no less desired). The party suffers a –10 penalty with Treasure Rolls on Table 7.15: Magic (see page 350). If this reduces the result below 0, roll on Table 7.11: Any, re-rolling Magic results (see page 345).</p><h4>REPUTABLE HEROES (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>Heroes are paragons in the eyes of the people and always given the benefit of the doubt. Reputation rewards are doubled.</p><h4>REVILED HEROES (2 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>Heroes are scorned by the people as trouble-makers, outlaws, or worse. Reputation rewards decrease to 1/2 normal (rounded up).</p><h4>SAVAGE WILDS (2 ACTION DICE)</h4><p>Vile creatures stalk the wilds, always on the lookout for a fresh meal. The action die cost of travel encounters decreases to 1/2 normal (rounded down, min. 1). If travel encounters are determined randomly (see page 373), the result range triggering an encounter doubles (e.g. a range of 1–3 becomes 1–6).</p><h4>SORCERY (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Magic is real and may be harnessed and controlled in the form of spells. NPCs gain this ability with the Spellcasting Signature Skill (see page 228), while player characters may take levels in one or more arcane caster classes (see page 110). You may tailor magic with these additional qualities.</p><p><strong>Corrupting Magic (3 Action Dice):</strong> Magic is a vile force that twists the caster’s body and mind. Each time a character casts a spell, he must also make a Will save (DC 10 + the number of spell points spent to make the check). With failure, he gains 1 grade of the following condition.</p><p><em>Tainted (I–IV plus special):</em> The character suffers a –2 penalty with Will saves and Charisma-based skill checks per grade suffered. If a character with tainted IV is tainted again, he instead becomes an NPC under the GM’s control. A character loses 1 tainted grade at the end of each scene.</p><p><strong>Cyclical Magic (2 Action Dice):</strong> Magic ebbs and flows like the tides (e.g. according to lunar cycles or calendar periods, or as a finite source is depleted). At the start of the scene, roll 1d6: with a 1–2, all characters’ spell points decrease to 1/2 (rounded down); with a 4–5, they remain the same; and with a 5–6 they increase by 50% (rounded up). This effect lasts the entire scene.</p><p><strong>Difficult Magic (3 Action Dice):</strong> Magic is a rare and exotic art, exceedingly difficult and time-consuming to perform. The DCs of Spellcasting checks increase by 5 and the Casting Times of spells double.</p><p><strong>Easy Magic (1 Action Die):</strong> Magic is easily mastered and may be performed with a literal flick of the wrist. The DCs of Spellcasting checks decrease by 5 and the Casting Times of spells decrease to 1/2 (min. 1 free action).</p><p><strong>Lost Magic (Permanent):</strong> One or more Schools or Disciplines have been lost, though a fledging black market exists for the knowledge. Choose any number of Schools and/or Disciplines. To gain a spell from one of them, a character must also spend Reputation equal to 5 × the spell’s level (min. 5).</p><p><strong>Potent Magic (2 Action Dice):</strong> Magic is particularly powerful and difficult to resist. The Save DCs of spells increase by 5 and the numerical results of spells, if any, increase by 50% (rounded up).</p><p><strong>Random Magic (Permanent):</strong> Magic is an unpredictable talent. When a character learns one or more spells, he selects the spell’s level and randomly generates the spell learned on Table 3.2: Spells (see page 114). The character may re-roll the result if he already knows this random spell.</p><p><strong>Ubiquitous Magic (Permanent):</strong> Magic is a common or innate talent available to virtually everyone. Every character automatically knows a number of Level 0 spells equal to his Wisdom modifier (min. 0) and may cast these spells automatically once per session with a Casting Level of 1.</p><p><strong>Wild Magic (2 Action Dice):</strong> Magic is unpredictable or difficult to control, leading to… exciting critical successes and failures. The threat and error ranges of Spellcasting checks increase by 2 and when a character scores critical success or failure, roll 1d6 and consult Table</p><h4>7.4: Wild Magic (see below).</h4><table style=\"text-align:left\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:60px\">Result</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Capricious: Each Aligned character gains a +2 bonus with unopposed Alignment skill checks and a –2 penalty with opposed Alignment skill checks.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Gracious: The starting action dice of each Aligned character rise by 2.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Meddling: Once per scene, each Aligned character must re-roll one successful skill check, attack check, or saving throw of the GM’s choice.

Money saved/earned through Prudence increases by 15% (e.g. a hero with a Prudence of 0 has a starting Money Saved/Earned of 30%).</p><h4>TRIUMPHANT HEROES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Tales of heroes’ outrageous exploits spread quickly. Whenever a hero scores a critical hit or success, he immediately gains Reputation equal to the number of action dice spent to activate the success minus 1.</p><h4>VERSATILE HEROES (PERMANENT)</h4><p>Heroes are world-wise veterans with diverse skill sets. A hero may gain ranks in any non-class or non-Origin skill at a cost of 2 skill points per rank.</p><h4>WIRE FU (1 ACTION DIE)</h4><p>The world sees high-flying action… literally. Special characters may move in any direction and across any surface — even up walls, over water, and through the air. If at the end of a character’s movement he isn’t on a solid surface, he falls (or submerges). Also, falling damage decreases to 1/2 normal (rounded up).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"ADVENTURE BUILDING","type":"text","_id":"AnBygFLJnc2hzLaz","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>An adventure is a loose script for one episode in the party’s saga — it may stand alone as a uniquely enjoyable and fulfilling experience or become one part of a campaign, a series of adventures that may or may not share plot, adversaries, locations, and other elements (see page 356). Here we introduce the basics for every adventure.</p><p>Most adventures consist of three to five scenes, each focusing on a sequence of events or series of problems. A scene is similar to an act in a television episode or stage play, though the action isn’t confined to a single location (if desired, it can span an entire region, or beyond).</p><p>A scene is further divided into one or more encounters, each consisting of a single challenge facing the party, such as a combat, puzzle, investigation, series of linked skill uses (like a Complex Task), or a pivotal and important roleplaying exchange (like a negotiation or interrogation).</p><p>The duration and scope of each scene are left up to you, as they depend on the adventure’s story, though natural breaks should become apparent as you develop your adventure. Conversely, an encounter’s duration and scope are largely fixed and set by the specific challenge at hand.</p><h2>STORY SEEDS</h2><p>All adventures start with one or more story seeds, or big hooks to spark the action. Decide the basic thrust of your story up to the point when the characters become involved. Don’t worry about how they might respond, or even how they’ll get involved, but make sure the idea offers plenty of room for them to have an impact on the outcome.</p><p>If you’re stumped for ideas, choose or randomly roll one on Table 7.5: Story Seeds (see page 328), or read through the examples for inspiration. Most of these seeds are deliberately incomplete so you can adapt them to your world and ongoing campaign (if you’re running one).</p><blockquote><h3>YOUR FIRST ADVENTURE: KEEP IT SIMPLE</h3><p>When building an adventure it’s easy to bite off more than you can chew: complex story seeds can confuse or frustrate the players; elusive or difficult goals or clues can lead the party astray; too many NPCs can make it hard to keep track of the cast; and too many adversaries, or too many types of adversaries, can bog the game down.</p><p>It’s best to start small, easing into greater detail as you get comfortable being a Fantasy Craft GM. In your first adventure, it’s probably best to limit yourself to one story seed, a single clear motivation (preferably for the whole party), and no more than two to three types of adversaries (with standard adversaries outnumbering the party by no more than two to one). You’ll find this a boon in those inevitable moments when the adventure goes somewhere unexpected, forcing you to improvise.</p></blockquote><h2>PC MOTIVATIONS</h2><p>Equally important are the characters’ reasons for getting involved, which can include curiosity, moral or ethical outrage, greed, lust, fear, anger, remorse, resentment, loyalty, a yen for excitement or discovery, a burning desire for revenge, the desperate need to survive, the simple need to win, or anything else that ignites the party’s passion.</p><p>It’s important that the characters’ motivations justify the risk (to them), which can be tricky given that most adventures involve at least some chance of serious injury or death. You might take away that every adventure should whip the party into a frenzy but this is problematic for two reasons: first, extreme emotions are taxing and wear on player stamina, especially over time; and second, some players may see this as justification to act out or even cross the line, pushing the game into dark, amoral territory.</p><p>The best motivations are tailored specifically to the characters, hitting them where they live and driving them to decisive, personal action. Any part of a character’s background may work for this but Subplots are especially useful; threatened Dependents, the object of a Search, or the appearance of a Nemesis or Rival are just a few of the many highly effective options (see page 379). Of course, Subplots don’t always apply to the entire party, so it’s a good idea to come up with something for the other characters as well.</p><p>Most parties can be enticed to adventure with the simple promise of… more. Fantasy characters are notoriously hungry for coin, treasure, and power — all of which are available as a matter of course in nearly every Fantasy Craft adventure. These old standbys are useful but like extreme conditions can grow tiresome if overused. Vary the motivations from adventure to adventure and watch for opportunities to introduce new reasons for the characters to adventure.</p><h4>Table 7.5: Story Seeds</h4><table style=\"text-align:left\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:40px\">Roll</th><th>Story</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The party learns that a savage orc war-tribe intends to attack a local trading post in three days’ time.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>A friend of the party is (presumably) framed for murder.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Farms are being ravaged by giant insects.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The greatest diplomats of the civilized world are gathering to discuss a potentially explosive border dispute.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Children are being abducted, reportedly by a gypsy clan.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>A strange melody haunts a local monastery, which has closed its doors and is refusing visitors.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Graves are being robbed — or are they?

It offers near-limitless control over every aspect of an NPC, from its statistics to its abilities to its demeanor and more. It also makes building NPCs a snap, even on the fly, which can be helpful when your adventure skews in an unexpected direction. To keep this to a minimum, however, you should dedicate some effort to making NPCs that serve your adventure’s story and appropriately challenge the party.</p><p>Don’t waste your time building every NPC the characters might meet and every adversary they might fight, and don’t slather every character with piles of background the players will never hear or mind. Start with the characters most vital to your adventure and ask yourself what makes them interesting and fun (both to you and to the players). The Beyond the Stats section in Chapter 6 can get you started with several random tables for names, quirks, and motivations (see pages 249–252) but again, you should try to tailor each character to your adventure whenever possible.</p><p>Think about what each character wants and needs, and how he fills his days. Not every villain must be vile, nor must every town champion be righteous. Creating three-dimensional characters with personal likes and dislikes, biases and creeds, will go a long way toward making your world believable and captivating, and can only draw the players deeper into the action as they start to wonder about what’s going on inside the heads of friends, enemies, and others. It will also give you plenty of grist for getting into character, making the experience unique to each NPC the party meets and fights.</p><p>With opponents you should take the process a step further, exploring their strategies and battlefield behavior. Intelligent combatants with something special to bring to the fight are far more interesting enemies for everyone — you’ll find them more fun to play and the heroes will appreciate that they’re matching clashing steel with worthy foes. Even animals and other low- Intelligence enemies, driven by base needs like hunger, anger, fear, curiosity, and protecting their young, leave you plenty of options: an unusual attack style or clever maneuver can work wonders, making the opponent memorable and (potentially) more dangerous.</p><p>Always consider the types of adversaries the players want to fight. Do they prefer to fight mobs of standard NPCs or solitary, powerful opponents? Are they more excited by straightforward bash ‘em ups, guerilla combats with periodic lulls between short- but-fierce skirmishes, explosive matches against creatures with lots of flashy abilities, complex tests of wit and will that demand their full attention, or something else entirely? Most groups prefer a combination of these options, which places the onus on you to shake the NPCs up in each adventure.</p><p>Adversaries, especially humanoids and their servants, often have hierarchies that you can exploit to great effect. Their organization and relations between enemy ranks can define them just as much as their abilities and tactics.</p><p>• A troll answering to a hobgoblin tribe is instantly intriguing. How did this relationship come about and what keeps it in place? If the troll is enslaved or resents his servitude, perhaps the characters can use that to their advantage. This would be an excellent new objective in the adventure.</p><p>• The leaders of a massing enemy army might not agree on how best to use it. Not only could one or more of them become allies, their differences of opinion could be showcased with radically divergent approaches to dealing with the PCs.</p><blockquote><h3>YOUR FIRST ADVENTURE: GETTING THE PARTY TOGETHER</h3><p>It’s easy to start with the party already together, especially if the players know each other and have a rhythm. In this case they might devise the party’s history when creating their characters or develop it over time as interesting ideas come up in play. These are excellent chances for you to award them action dice.</p><p>If you’re playing with strangers, or want to give the players the chance to roleplay their party coming together, you can start with their first meeting. Characters can join forces by accident (wrong place, right time), through mutual acquaintances or organizations (like guilds), or out of necessity (say, to escape from a kobold warren where they’re all held). The story of the party’s origin could easily become a full adventure but in your first outing it’s best to keep it to a brief scene with a single encounter, perhaps two if you include a small combat.</p><p>You can run the scene as a flashback if you’d like it to precede your first adventure by a while (see page 334), but even if you do be sure to include rewards as normal (see page 342). It’s part of the party’s saga, after all, even if the risk is somewhat lower (and it should be — heroes shouldn’t die before the opening credits).</p><h3>YOUR FIRST ADVENTURE: RUN WHAT YOU KNOW</h3><p>Not sure where to begin? No problem. You can base NPCs on people you know in the real world, historical figures, or even characters from movies or books. You can do the same with locations, scene concepts, puzzles, and even plot points. This is especially helpful when you’re short on time.</p><p>It’s best to use ideas you’re reasonably sure the players haven’t encountered, but you can “re-skin” the ones they might recognize. For example, you might base a sage on the wizard Akiro from the Conan the Barbarian movies, replacing his signature furs with heavy robes or swapping out his voice for a booming baritone.</p></blockquote><h2>LOCATIONS</h2><p>There are many things to consider when deciding where adventures take the party, but the most important is fun. Adventures can take place anywhere: in sprawling cities or quaint towns; in deep, dank dungeons or the cold, sterile halls of an abandoned castle; in any wilderness you can imagine; and beyond. Every location has its own flavor and you can use this to deepen and drive the adventure.</p><p>Consider the history of the place. Who lived there and why? Does anyone (or anything) remain? What was their culture and how much, if any of it remains? What momentous events occurred there? Was it the site of famous battles, desperate treaties, religious trials, or unexplained phenomena? What happens at the site today? Is it important to any nations, organizations, or individuals? How frequently is it visited and why? What do visitors see, hear, smell, taste, and feel?</p><p>Ecology is a critical question for any location that’s home to living creatures: What do they eat and where do they sleep? What’s their daily routine? Where and how do they breed? How do they interact with other inhabitants? Do they hunt other creatures or are they hunted themselves?</p><p>The answers to these questions can be as fantastic and wild as you like but no matter how incredible the location it has to be plausible within the setting — to you and to the players — or it threatens the integrity of your game. A traditional high fantasy campaign can withstand the improbable a great deal more easily than, say, a political or dark one. Also keep in mind that the more remarkable a location is, the greater the chance the party will fixate on it — potentially instead of the adventure’s plot. Too much detail can have the opposite effect, turning the players off or worse, overshadowing the greater experience.</p><p>The best locations offer plenty of choices and things for the characters to do without giving the characters so much freedom that they can accidentally skip the scene(s) you’ve prepared for the area. In a military scenario, for example, a wide canyon might offer a waterfall to hide behind, evading enemies, tall trees that can be used to launch ambushes against unwitting soldiers passing below, soft earth allowing for pit traps and gear caches, unstable cliff faces that can be collapsed to block pursuers or create advantageous terrain, and more. At the same time the canyon is a self-contained location, preventing the characters from wandering too far from the action.</p><p>Locations can also offer plenty of challenge. In an epic fantasy setting, a contested crossroads might be a confluence of sheer rock outcroppings spiking up out of what’s believed to be a bottomless chasm separating the civilized lands of men and the untamed wilds beyond. The characters might track a group of brigands there, seeking to regain the holy relic they stole, setting the stage for a perilous battle against a thrilling backdrop. The GM could take this a step further by having the brigands weaken the bridges or plant traps on them, or maybe enlist the help of a boulder-chucking troll who pummels the bridges with tons of ferrous rock.</p><p>A few more things to keep in mind when developing locations: First, don’t fret about details that won’t come into play. Foraging options are well and good but only if you intend to ask the party for Survival checks in the area. Second, try to view locations through the party’s eyes. Unless rushed by the plot, characters almost always look for ways to get more information before proceeding. What can they hear through a door, or see and hear from each part of the area? What’s likely to be most interesting or enticing to them (and is it where you want them to go most)? Finally, never underestimate a party’s greed or its potential to derail an adventure. Yes, fixtures made of gold are impressive but they’re also likely to slow the party’s progress as they try to pry them from the walls.</p><h3>MAPS</h3><p>Depending on your play style and the needs of your adventure, you may have to draw maps for some locations. You can do this by hand (it’s easier and more accurate with graph paper), or use one of many online or software options developed for fantasy RPGs. Fantasy Craft uses the standard grid scale (1 square = 5 ft.), which works great with the most commonly used miniatures and dry and wet erase play mats on the market.</p><p>As you place halls, rooms, doors, traps, obstacles, secret areas, fixed treasure, and other features, it’s helpful to keep some things in mind, including party and character size and speeds, line of sight, potential terrain modifiers, spell and ability ranges, and scrying and other far-viewing options. You might also want to note locked doors and portals, as well as any NPCs, adversaries, and magic effects in each area.</p><p>If any events in your adventure change the location itself, you might want to draw before and after maps as well.</p><blockquote><h3>YOUR FIRST ADVENTURE: RUN WHAT YOU’VE GOT</h3><p>Just as you can draw from your experience when building an adventure, you can steal to fill in the gaps. Don’t have time to draw a map for your next adventure? Rummage through your adventure collection and lift one from an old classic (perhaps making a few revisions to disguise your thievery). Recycle NPC stats with a few strategic changes or borrow those from adventures or the Crafty Games forums. Collect art from your favorite websites and products and build a gallery you can draw from when you need to give the players visual reference for an NPC, monster, or location. You can even factor your collections into your adventure building process, choosing the visuals and creating statistics or other missing components to support them in play.</p></blockquote>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"SCENES AND ENCOUNTERS","type":"text","_id":"rhLqr5GErCECmcSu","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Commonly, adventures span three to five scenes organized like a three-act stage play or multi-act TV episode.</p><p><strong>Opening Scene (Setup):</strong> This introduces the initial problem or challenge facing the characters, as well as initial adversaries and important NPCs, and compels the party to act. It kicks off with a bang, frequently in media res (the action already in progress), stirring the players and immediately drawing them into the adventure, and often ends with a minor plot twist or turning point in the story.</p><p><strong>Middle Scenes (Pursuits and Confrontations):</strong> These scenes feature rising action and tension, periodically pausing for the party to regroup and take stock. Challenges and adversaries grow more powerful and dangerous, and the story urges the characters ever onward, leading to revelations and commonly a major turning point in the story (and possibly one or more significant plot twists as well).</p><p><strong>Closing Scene (Resolution):</strong> The characters learn any remaining secrets and face the greatest adversaries the adventure has to throw at them. In the best closing scenes, the party’s actions in previous scenes determine the conditions of the final confrontation, including pivotal perks or disadvantages.

Some adventures fade with a fitting denouement and offer hooks for more in subsequent game sessions.</p><p>Your adventure may vary, of course, having any number of scenes and reordering or revising as you like.</p><h3>SCENE CONSIDERATIONS</h3><p>As a rule, each scene should focus on a single sequence of (related) events or problems. The action can take place in one or more locations, though in most cases multiple areas should be close together or some kind of swift travel should be available. Any prolonged pause in the action, due to travel or other factors, is probably grounds for a separate scene. There are exceptions, of course, like a single scene that covers all the events in a weeklong political caucus or one that covers random events over a month of guard duty at the edge of an army encampment.</p><p>Given the incredible versatility and wide number of options available when building scenes, there aren’t many rules for doing them well — what works for one group may fail for another and there’s always room for improvement. Experience is your best guide but here are a few pieces of accumulated wisdom, some specific to Fantasy Craft, some universal to all systems.</p><p><em>General Scene Guidance</em></p><p>• Don’t assume the characters will pursue any particular path, choose any particular option, or respond in any particular way (even if you think they’re “obvious” or “right” (or even when they’re established at the outset as “heroic” or “appropriate” things to do). Include multiple, interesting ways to accomplish each objective and whenever possible prepare for the party to ignore or change objectives as well.</p><p>• Don’t employ deus ex machina (the sudden introduction of a plot device to save the day) or sideline the party. Players rarely have fun when they’re denied the spotlight and/or control of the action.</p><p>• Don’t shy away from exciting ideas, no matter how weird they are (this is fantasy, after all), but do ensure that everything in your scenes is plausible in your world.</p><p>• Avoid truly random events and situations (that come out of nowhere, independent or contrary to previous events and situations). The best events and situations believably arise from previous ones.</p><p>• Build scenes that keep the energy level high but be sure to also give the players chances to breathe (excitement is fun but non-stop excitement can burn everyone out, including you).</p><p>• Experiment with scene construction. Try different ways to introduce and support story. At the very least, make sure each scene in a single adventure presents its own unique flavor and challenge.</p><p><em>Promoting Story</em></p><p>• Offer regular opportunities for the players to get into and stay in character, including ample chances for in-character dialog and plenty of engaging questions and ideas to address. Put the characters in positions where they have to define or defend their personal beliefs.</p><p>• Develop NPCs that challenge the characters intellectually and emotionally as well as physically and magically. A duel of wits and will can be just as exciting as the most desperate combat — and sometimes more.</p><p>• Confront the characters with tough emotional, strategic, or heroic decisions, sometimes with no clear path to victory. Empower them to forge their legends in the face of adversity and they’ll only ever win (even when they lose). A word of caution: don’t dangle mechanical rewards to influence the party’s decisions, or openly deny them rewards for choosing the “wrong” course. This can lead to resentment and damage the players’ respect for you as a Game Master.</p><p>• Use the characters’ decisions, however small, to change the world and course of the adventure. Plan for these watershed events when building adventures but watch for them during play as well — some of the most defining moments in your game will be unplanned.</p><p>• Create reasons for the party to embrace the story. Make them not want to skip it to get to the next die roll. Do this by making the story directly relevant and exciting to the players. Hook them and the character will follow.</p><p><em>Challenging the Party</em></p><p>• Don’t pre-empt or negate the characters’ abilities. They’ve worked hard to gain them.</p><p>• Develop encounters that play to, and test, the characters’ strengths. Players appreciate being good at things. They appreciate winning through excellence even more, especially if it’s by the skin of their teeth.</p><p>• Create objectives the party can accomplish as a team. Likewise, don’t leave any of them with nothing to do.</p><p>• Test the party with unconventional situations that demand unconventional solutions. Require the players think about what else their characters can do.</p><p>• Don’t let NPCs steal the spotlight. Likewise, make sure NPCs aren’t in a position to, even if the players ask for their help.</p><p><em>Developing Encounters</em></p><p>• Vary the types and pacing of encounters from scene to scene, and within each scene (combat, skill use, problem solving, roleplaying, investigation). Try to make each encounter distinct and special.</p><p>• Especially at first, follow the guidance on page 243 regarding how many adversaries to throw at the party. Be careful not to make fights too easy or difficult, and when in doubt skew low. You can always add reinforcements with action dice (see page 368).</p><p>• Incorporate reasons for characters to vary their tactics and use sub-optimal abilities, perhaps offering bonus action dice or Instant Rewards for doing so (see page 344).</p><p>• Don’t hinge success on a single die roll or choice, even one of those tough choices mentioned two sections back. Not only does this dramatically increase the chance of failure, it’s horribly anti-climactic.</p><p>• Give the enemy a reason not to kill player characters outright. No one wants to lose a character because they fail a saving throw and it’s always more interesting when the players have a chance to chat with the opposition face-to-face.</p><h3>SCENE TRANSITIONS</h3><p>Characters can move from one scene to another by performing or completing tasks, acting on information, moving from one location to another, or even without knowing (e.g. if the scene shift occurs at a certain time or due to an event the party doesn’t know is happening). You may keep the players abreast of the scenes they’re in or wait for it to come up (usually when the players ask if they can use an ability or option that’s limited by scene).</p><p>Moving between scenes can be one of the trickiest aspects of running Fantasy Craft, especially when the party’s options aren’t obvious or, for one reason or another, the story hasn’t progressed to a point where the action can fluidly shift. One of your most important jobs as Game Master is keeping the pace of play brisk and engaging at all times, which means that while the players are busy staying in character, chasing down enemies, and completing objectives you’re performing a delicate balancing act to keep them occupied.</p><p>Ideally, while one scene is playing out, you should be thinking about the next and considering contingencies if the party strays from the expected path (and they will). Redundancy is your greatest tool here. In a perfect world, each scene transition should feature at least two unconnected avenues, one of which you can prompt without action from the characters (such as information plausibly acquired by allies or clues you can reveal in the party’s current location, no matter where they are). Each additional way to get from one scene to another is that much less chance the adventure falters if the characters overlook or misinterpret critical pointers.</p><h4>THE ADVENTURE FLOWCHART</h4><p>One of the easiest ways to organize your scenes is with an adventure flowchart. Start with a box containing the title of your first scene and draw a line from it to a box containing the title of each scene into which it might transition (scenes often lead into two or more others, especially when the action is driven by character choice, as during an investigation). Repeat this for each avenue you’ve built into the adventure, labeling each line. If you like, you can add the necessary clue(s) or other triggers alongside these labels.</p><p>This gives you a visual guide you can reference during play and can also highlight any potential issues with your scene structure, like too few avenues into a critical scene or optional side scenes that don’t push the characters back to the main plot.</p><h4>THE ADVENTURE TIMELINE</h4><p>Another helpful tool you can incorporate into your adventure is a timeline of fixed events, as well as those triggered by player actions. Fixed and triggered events are a great way to keep the action going, especially when you leave yourself the option to put them into play early if the adventure slows down. They can also help the players feel like they’re part of a living, breathing world where things happen even without their direct involvement, and also put pressure on them to keep moving forward (lest opportunities slip through their fingers).</p><h3>PLANNING YOUR REVEALS</h3><p>One of the easiest ways an adventure can go astray is lack of information. Characters missing a vital clue can unknowingly focus on unimportant details or worse, become convinced that a red herring is the intended plot. Part of building a successful adventure is making sure the party finds the all-important details that explain the story and lead them in the right direction(s).</p><p>On the flip side, it’s often critical to withhold information. For instance, revealing a villain can be a dicey proposition as players are notoriously single-minded — and short-sighted — when it comes to the enemy. They’ll rush headlong into a fight with anything short of a god if they think he’s behind their current woes (and might still charge in unless there’s hard evidence that the god can kill them — because after all, why would you put anything in their line of sight they can’t knock over?).</p><p>Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to determine the order in which characters should learn details, even if you can’t control how the players will react to them. Build a checklist in the desired order of revelation and you can also use it as a record of facts gained during play. Again, make sure that every important detail can be found in multiple ways, at least a few of which should seem obvious to the players (every play group is different, so this will take some second-guessing). Flag reveals you think the players will act on immediately, possibly with an asterisk, and when you’re running the adventure you’ll know to take an extra moment to consider whether they might jeopardize a scene or encounter.</p><p>Keep in mind that many player characters have access to spells and abilities they can use to learn information early, so you might want to pad your revelation list with some interesting but less pivotal facts, or even questions that get the players thinking along the right lines without providing the full truth. Flag these separately, perhaps with a triangle or another symbol of choice.</p><h4>CLUES AND HINTS</h4><p>Every piece of information built into your adventure and every detail on your revelation list is by default a clue (see page 335), which means that characters can learn them through various abilities and skill uses, among other means. You can also offer them as hints (see page 366), which is another way to ensure the essentials are revealed to the party. Again, you can simply tick off items as they’re discovered.</p><h3>LEAVING ROOM TO IMPROVISE</h3><p>No matter how much preparation you put into an adventure, the players are bound to take it in directions you never dreamed possible. This is the beauty and the curse of a roleplaying game — the characters can at least attempt to do anything, no matter how irrational or outlandish. What this means is that there’s a very real limit to the amount of work you can put into an adventure before it starts working against you. The more you set in stone, the less room you leave yourself to react to the players’ actions.</p><p>What’s the practical limit? It’s different for every GM and adventure but the best advice we can give is to stop building just as soon as the adventure makes sense. After that you’re just embellishing, which is something that’s often best handled during the game anyway.</p><h3>TESTING YOUR ADVENTURE</h3><p>The last step before running your adventure is test-running it. If possible, take a couple days after completing your initial build. This will clear the details from your head and help you spot any issues that might otherwise seem fine. If you’ve got them handy, glance over the player characters, paying close attention to what they can do and the gear they have. Read through your adventure top to bottom, scene by scene, and try to anticipate the party’s actions and reactions. Note any changes but don’t make them until you’re done with your pass.</p><p>Make any changes and if you have time (and unless you’re confident the adventure’s good to go), repeat the process. It’s amazing how just a couple dry runs in the right mindset can improve the experience for everyone.</p><p>YOUR FIRST ADVENTURE:</p><blockquote><h3>WHAT TO INCLUDE</h3><p>From the outset, you’ll find yourself drawn to build and record adventures in your own way. You might prefer comprehensive, meticulously organized files or loose lists of notes, each condensing a complete thought into a word or phrase. You might prepare full scripts to read as the characters arrive at each location and face each event, or you might improvise them from memory. Use whatever method works best for you and organize your materials however will help you find things fastest in play. The process can be refined over time but the most important thing is to develop a reliable system. This will keep you from shuffling for things you need at the table.</p></blockquote><h2>CINEMATIC SCENE STYLES</h2><p>Movies and television can teach us a lot about RPG storytelling. Not only are the story structures similar but many of the same tools can be exploited to great effect — like these alternate scene styles.</p><h3>CUT SCENES</h3><p>A cut-scene shifts the players’ perspective to simultaneous events at another location, leaving the characters oblivious (“Meanwhile…”). You can use a cut-scene to reveal details without the characters reacting but there’s a significant pitfall: some players respond poorly to losing control of the story. Their reaction may worsen if the cut-scene is long or dull.</p><p>There are a couple workarounds. First, always keep cutscenes short and concise, and give the players plenty of chances to ask questions. Alternately, you might prepare a cut-scene as a playable encounter or scene, letting the group assume alternate roles. For example, the players could become minions acting in service to a villain. Not only do they get to play the bad guys for a bit but their superiors could reveal important information about the enemy’s plans that for storytelling reasons you want the players to know.</p><h3>DREAM SEQUENCES</h3><p>Another excellent way to safely convey information is the dream sequence, which poses two dangers. First, unless there’s an explanation for more than one character sharing a dream — e.g. magic or supernatural abilities — only one player may be involved. Second, unless you state upfront that the characters are having a dream you run the risk of betraying their trust or destroying their suspension of disbelief.</p><p>Once you work out the reasons for a shared dream, however, you can use this method to remind players about important clues, foreshadow upcoming events, or raise new questions, perhaps in surreal or frightening ways. Dreams being what they are, you can get away with a lot when building them, taking the characters to places and confronting them with creatures and situations they’d never encounter in the waking world.</p><h3>FLASHBACKS</h3><p>A flashback focuses on past events, with the players taking other roles or playing younger versions of their characters. This is a popular way to reveal how the party came together, or let the players take an active role in a big setting or story reveal. The issue, of course, is that the past can’t change, not in any way that’s established as canon, which is why it’s critical that you spend extra time looking for potential paradox and developing ways to explain any that might arise.</p><p>As an example, when playing through a flashback revealing the secret history of a powerful mage in the modern setting, the party might inadvertently cause his death. You could let him escape death (see page 385), or you might work his death into the story as a new reveal. Make it the moment the characters realize that the modern mage is an imposter, perhaps with a nefarious agenda.</p><h3>FLASH-FORWARDS AND MONTAGES</h3><p>With a flash-forward (see page 367), you can advance to a more interesting period of play. It’s helpful when the action heads into tedious or unscripted (and unimportant) directions. As with any cinematic scene style, there’s a chance that using a flash-forward will irk some players, so it’s a good idea to politely suggest it rather than spring it on the group without warning. Some players may prefer to redirect their actions without interruption and if that can happen quickly you should probably oblige.</p><p>You can sometimes turn a shaky flash-forward into an asset by revealing fun bits about the “missing” period over time, starting at the point when play resumes. Cut to a new location, add several bizarre details (“You ride up to the inn at dusk the next evening, covered in tar and acorns. You dismiss questions with an irritated wave of your sticky arms, mutter something about demented pixies, and stomp up to your rooms.”), and let the players wonder. You can go back to the gag whenever you like, even introducing NPCs that the characters met, fought, loved, and lost, but be careful — this is a tactic best used sparingly, with great respect and not a little wit.</p><p>Another variant on the flash-forward is the montage, which lets you summarize lengthy and mundane periods of play with a brief, often pithy description. Players can get involved as well and if you’re up for it you could even turn the scene into a round-robin or free-for-all storytelling exercise. Montages are a wonderful way to handle Downtime (see page 371).</p><h3>PARALLEL SCENES</h3><p>When interesting things happen in two places at once (e.g. the party splits up or some of them are captured), you can run a parallel scene, in which you shift the focus back and forth, highlighting important activities in each area. This keeps everyone involved but it runs the risk of players getting bored when your focus is elsewhere.</p><p>Thus it’s best to run parallel scenes at a brisk pace — there’s no room for combat, Complex Tasks, or other lengthy endeavors without some kind of streamlined play or group shorthand. Flash-forwards may be required if the scenes bog down anyway.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":900000,"name":"MENACE","type":"text","_id":"7OmHpBPGrotSp9bP","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>With your story, adversaries, and other elements in hand, it’s time to apply the rules. Though you can do this in any order, it usually starts with the adventure’s “Menace,” or difficulty. Menace levels range from I to V (1 to 5) and adjusts Threat Level (see page 335), the number of Dramatic scenes (see page 335), and encounter threat (see pages 243–244), as well as the GM’s starting action dice (see page 365) Adventure rewards are automatically adjusted as well (see page 342).</p><p>Your choice of Menace is arbitrary, based entirely on how dangerous you want the adventure to be.</p><h3>I (TRIFLING)</h3><p>The adventure poses little true threat.</p><p><strong>Threat Level:</strong> –2</p><p><strong>Dramatic Scenes:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Encounters:</strong> Minor</p><h3>II (ROUTINE)</h3><p>The adventure is dangerous but nothing your average group of heroes can’t handle.</p><p><strong>Threat Level:</strong> +0</p><p><strong>Dramatic Scenes:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Encounters:</strong> Minor to Significant</p><h3>III (CHALLENGING)</h3><p>The adventure gives true heroes pause — but only for a second.

Like Career Level, it ranges from 1 to 20 but instead of representing aptitude it’s used to calculate NPC statistics (see page 240) and to calculate XP rewards (see page 342).</p><p>An adventure’s Threat Level is calculated at its start and generally remains the same throughout. To find Threat Level, simply average the characters’ Career Levels, rounding down (sum them and divide by the number of characters). If the adventure’s Menace is other than II (Routine), apply that modifier as well.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The TL for a team of 5 characters Levels 4, 7, 9, 10, and 18, is 9 (48 divided by 5, rounded down). If the adventure’s Menace is IV (Dangerous), the adventure’s TL is 11.</p><p>Specific NPCs can be calculated with modified Threat Levels. When this happens the NPC retains this TL for all purposes until the end of the adventure.</p><h2>SCENES</h2><p>You need to ask yourself four primary rules questions about every scene…</p><p>• Is it Standard or Dramatic?</p><p>• What are the Clues?</p><p>• What are the Objectives?</p><p>• Who are the Adversaries?</p><p>Let’s start at the top with…</p><h3>IS IT STANDARD OR DRAMATIC?</h3><p>Every scene is either “Standard” or “Dramatic,” indicating its general importance to the plot and/or the trouble characters will face therein.</p><p>During a <strong>Standard scene</strong>, the playing field is generally level and the chance of overall success is high. All standard Fantasy Craft rules apply.</p><p>During a <strong>Dramatic scene</strong>, the odds are stacked against the PCs and success is far from assured. Many rules change…</p><p>• The GM may spend any number of action dice on NPC die rolls and when healing NPCs (see page 365).</p><p>• Standard adversaries may activate critical successes and hits.</p><p>• Player characters may not Cheat Death (see page 384).</p><p>An adventure’s Menace determines the number of Dramatic scenes it has. You may distribute these any way you wish, though it’s generally a good idea to assign them to moments of high crisis in the story.</p><h3>WHAT ARE THE CLUES?</h3><p>As discussed in Scene Considerations (see page 331), it’s crucial to include several ways for the party to get from scene to scene. Clues are details worked into the plot that point the party in the right direction. They can be gained through class abilities like notebook and master tracker (see pages 39 and 50), or learned with the Investigate skill (see page 76). Clues can be standalone or strung into chains, one leading to the next.</p><p>When taking a final look at your scenes, search for potential clues to add. You never know when the characters will need a little help. Three or four for each avenue into or out of a scene is plenty. Clues that don’t rely on specific knowledge are especially helpful, as they can double as hints (see page 366).</p><h3>WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES?</h3><p>When building your adventure’s story you came up with plenty of things for the party to accomplish (see page 336). In the Fantasy Craft rules, each of these that doesn’t involve traps or evading, defeating, or otherwise “besting” adversaries becomes an “objective,” generating experience points for success (see page 337). Objectives include traditional quests and all the Complex Tasks, puzzles, and other obstacles the party must overcome along the way, as well as tasks the party undertakes to further Subplots (see page 379).</p><p>Start by compiling a list of things your party can do to enhance the story or further the plot. It may help to walk through each scene as you expect it to unfold (or to follow the adventure flowchart), noting each of the party’s steps along the way.</p><p>Depending on your play style, objectives can be loose and fluid or carefully defined. If you’re at all worried about confusion or debate at the table, we recommend you make sure each objective meets these four criteria.</p><p><strong>1. One Accomplishment per Objective</strong></p><p>Limit each objective to just one achievement. It’s easy to lump objectives together but this can also lead to confusion. For example, “sneak into the castle” might involve nothing more than evading guards, which is fine. However, if the scene also calls for the party to access deeper parts of the castle that are more heavily defended, then you might want to break it down into individual tasks or steps.</p><p><strong>2. Be Specific</strong></p><p>An objective should be something the party can definitively finish, without potential misunderstanding. “Avoid harm,” “safely enter a location,” “humiliate an NPC,” and similarly subjective phrases only work when you’re prepared to determine whether the party completes the objective on the fly, and reasonably certain the players will accept your ruling.</p><p>Instead, keep objectives simple and clear, without room for confusion (e.g. “Complete the scene without losing any wounds,” “enter the location undetected,” or “plant the (already introduced) incriminating evidence in the NPC’s quarters”).</p><p>Be careful also not to specifically limit an objective to an activity. “Search for keys” isn’t a strong objective because it’s not an accomplishment, though it does lead to one; instead, go with “obtain the keys,” which also covers stealing them, duplicating them, and other possible solutions.</p><p>A common mistake when building objectives is to add “perform a cool cinematic maneuver,” which should be rewarded but not as part of the adventure. Instead, watch for these as part of regular play, offering Instant Rewards when they come up (see page 344).</p><p><strong>3. Turn Negatives into Positives</strong></p><p>It’s bad form to inflict XP penalties, reducing the party’s XP reward (or worse, their existing XP total). This rules out objectives that penalize but fortunately it’s easy to turn those around. “Don’t get caught” can become “evade the guards,” for example, and “don’t let the king die” can become “prevent the king’s death” or “save the king.”</p><p><strong>4. Always Leverage Risk</strong></p><p>Every objective should involve some degree of risk and consequences for failure; otherwise it’s just free XP, which is hardly heroic. “Accept the quest” is a horrible objective, for example, as it requires nothing of the party and serves no purpose in the game other than to determine what the characters face next. Planning and entering locations are similarly problematic (unless the characters must convince someone to accept their plan, for example, or the location somehow threatens intruders).</p><p>For each objective, ask yourself whether the characters are in danger. If not, the task probably isn’t an objective.</p><h4>OBJECTIVE CHAINS</h4><p>Next, consider whether any objectives can be accomplished in escalating or subsequent steps. For example, a party interrogating a miscreant named Fortunado might earn a base amount of XP for gleaning 1 clue and progressively more for each additional one. The clues lead to a brigand hideout and more XP based on the number of characters who sneak or bluff their way in. Finally, the party earns additional XP for each covert step they take to bring the gang down.</p><p>In all these cases, a single objective becomes a “chain” and is structured accordingly. Here are some examples.</p><p>A. 1 clue gleaned<br />B. 2 clues gleaned<br />C. 3 clues gleaned<br />D. 4 or more clues gleaned</p><p>A. 1–2 characters inserted into the hideout<br />B. All characters inserted into the hideout</p><p>A. Sabotage brigands’ weapons without notice<br />B. Shoo away brigands’ horses without notice<br />C. Set traps at 1–2 hideout exits without notice<br />D. Set traps at 3–4 hideout exits without notice<br />E. Set traps at all the hideout exits without notice</p><p>The party only receives one XP reward in each chain. In the last example, if they set up traps at 3 exits, they earn XP for the “D” stage of that chain, not A, B, C, or E. Alternately, that could be structured as two or even three chains, allowing separate XP rewards.</p><p>A. Sabotage brigands’ weapons without notice<br />A. Shoo away brigands’ horses without notice<br />A Set traps at 1–2 hideout exits without notice<br />B. Set traps at 3–4 hideout exits without notice<br />C. Set traps at all the hideout exits without notice</p><h4>OBJECTIVE REWARDS</h4><p>Finally, assign each objective an XP value based on its difficulty and/or importance. For simplicity you can value objectives in increments of 25 XP, and for a rough gauge you can compare them to the adversaries featured in the same adventure. Very difficult objectives and those critical to the plot, the party, or the party’s employers should generally be valued significantly higher than the rest. The actual XP values are entirely up to you, though you should shoot for a total of 750 to 1,000 XP in combined objectives and adversaries if you want your campaign to progress at the default rate (see page 342).</p><p>Each step in an objective chain gets its own escalating XP reward. Here are some examples.</p><p>A. 1 clue gleaned: 25 XP<br />B. 2 clues gleaned: 50 XP<br />C. 3 clues gleaned: 75 XP<br />D. 4 or more clues gleaned: 100 XP</p><p>A. 1–2 characters inserted into the hideout (critical): 50 XP<br />B. All characters inserted into the hideout: 100 XP</p><p>A. Sabotage brigands’ weapons without notice: 50 XP<br />B. Shoo away brigands’ horses without notice: 75 XP<br />C. Set traps at 1–2 hideout exits without notice: 100 XP<br />D. Set traps at 3–4 hideout exits without notice: 200 XP<br />E. Set traps at all the hideout exits without notice: 300 XP</p><h3>WHO ARE THE ADVERSARIES?</h3><p>The rules for developing adversaries of all kinds, including monsters, are found in Chapter 6. Selecting statistics, qualities, attacks, and other options generates an adversary’s XP value, which is earned each time the party defeats the adversary, in or out of combat (sneaking past guards, for example, or dosing sleeping enemies before they can attack). XP is not earned for merely encountering an NPC (even an adversary); as with objectives, an element of risk must be involved.</p><p>Adversary XP values are applied differently for standard and special NPCs.</p><p><strong>Standard Adversaries:</strong> These appear in “mobs” equal in number to the player characters. The party earns the XP value for each mob defeated, with fewer yielding proportionately less (see page 240).</p><p><strong>Special Adversaries:</strong> These appear singly. The party earns the XP value for each individual defeated. Special Adversaries may also be designated “villains,” which gives them the option to ignore Disposition and Morale effects (see pages 373 and 379) and Cheat Death (see page 384), among other benefits.</p><p>When building an adventure, you should have a stat block ready for each adversary the party may face and each of these should be designated standard or special (and if special, potentially a villain). The story will generally inform your decision (e.g. packs of gnolls should probably be standard, perhaps with a special leader), but if you’re unsure it’s best to ask whether each adversary deserves to be special; if not, then make them standard. Don’t worry, you can upgrade any single standard NPC to special by spending 2 action dice in play (see page 365).</p><p>You can even vary NPC designations between adventures!</p><p><em>Example:</em> In a murder mystery, the characters find themselves hunting the killer of a beloved prince. The trail leads to a local merchant, who until now has been a standard NPC the players occasionally interact with when selling the spoils of their labors. This time around he’s a witness, the last person to see the prince alive, and potentially a prime suspect once the characters learn he recently sold the prince’s royal jewelry. The GM could still keep him a standard NPC but decides to upgrade him to a special adversary so he’s a bit more capable when the characters set their sights on him. After the truth comes to light (that the merchant sold the prince’s jewelry to help fund his fake death and escape from his corrupt father), the merchant might go back to being a pleasant bit player, probably with a shift back to standard as well.</p><p>NPCs share the same basic statistics whether they’re standard or special and whether they’re adversaries or not, which makes it a simple process to change things up whenever you want.</p><h2>TRAPS</h2><p>This section covers location traps like lava pits, collapsing ceilings, and giant crushing balls rolling through corridors (see Table 7.6: Traps, page 339). Portable traps can be found in Chapter 4 (see page 160).</p><p>Unlike portable traps, these generate XP (see page 342), though only when the party overcomes them. A party that never encounters a trap earns no XP for it.</p><p>Every location trap starts with a good concept. What does it look like? How big is it? How does it work? How is it triggered? What excruciating fate does it offer its unfortunate victims? Most of these questions are answered by defining five trap traits. This also determines the trap’s XP value (simply add the trait values together).</p><p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> This defines the trap’s physical appearance and/or trigger, as well as a second skill that may be used to bypass the device (see page 339). A bypassed trap is not triggered and may be set off later.</p><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> This sets the Complexity and number of Challenges needed to Bypass or Disable the trap (as a Complex Task). Failure with even one Challenge attempt triggers the trap, as does failing the Task.</p><p><strong>Concealment:</strong> This is the trap’s Stash bonus, which opposes Notice and Search checks to spot it (when the installer is known, his Stash bonus is used instead). A party that doesn’t spot a trap before stumbling into it automatically triggers it.</p><p><strong>Target:</strong> This determines which characters are affected when the trap is triggered and offers a few sample trap actions.

However, unless you and your group are quick on your feet and possess strong improv skills, you should probably put a little thought into a Task before including it. Otherwise you run the risk of turning the event into just another series of dull, sterile rolls.</p><h3>PROGRESS VS. PRECISION TASKS</h3><p>The basic rules on page 67 describe Progress Tasks, in which the characters advance a step in the process with each successful Challenge. The Task may be timed (with the party racing to complete the last step before the clock runs down), or not (in which case the Task determines how long the whole process takes).</p><p>When desired, there’s another option. In a Precision Task, the action advances a step whether the characters succeed or fail and each Challenge becomes an independent step or stage in the process. Precision Tasks are always timed and the party wins if by the end they score more successes than failures. Ties may be defined as success or failure, as you prefer.</p><p>To determine the type of Task that best suits your adventure, take a look at the action. Can the characters attack the problem in more than one way or complete steps out of order? If not, then you’re definitely looking at a Progress Task. Is the Task more about getting things done or doing things right? Can the characters fail and keep going? Is there a time limit? The solution should quickly become clear.</p><h3>SCRIPTING PERIL</h3><p>Critical for many groups is the “Task script,” which defines the skill(s) used and adds flavor, obstacles, and/or danger to the process. Ideally, a script develops unique identity for each Challenge (or in a timed Task, each Challenge attempt). It doesn’t have to be long or complex — one distinct detail per Challenge is plenty, and you can even leave some brief or simple Challenges open to be described as you go. A well-conceived script lends to this, giving the players plenty of ideas for filling in the gaps.</p><p>To get started just pick a skill and check DC for each Challenge, then add one or two of the following events. Feel free to skip events for Challenges you feel the characters will easily overcome.</p><p>• Combat: Perhaps for succeeding or failing at a Challenge, perhaps when the characters reach a Challenge or at a specific time, adversaries arrive to make their lives difficult.</p><p>• Damage for Failure: The characters suffer a certain amount of damage if they fail the Challenge attempt.</p><p>• Extra Check: One or more characters unexpectedly have to make a check in addition to the Challenge. Unless the check is a free action, the characters making it may not be able to help with the current Challenge.</p><p>• Extra/Less Time: Generally with a successful or failed Challenge attempt, the characters gain a bit more or less time to complete the Task.</p><p>• Gear Bonus/Penalty: A particular piece of gear is especially helpful or hurtful when attempting the Challenge, applying a bonus or penalty.</p><p>• Reward: For taking a particular action, the characters gain a reward (e.g. 1–2 Reputation, a Treasure Roll, etc.).</p><p>• Skill Bonus/Penalty: Conditions present during the attempt apply a bonus or penalty with the Challenge or another skill.</p><p>• Trap: With failure, the characters trigger a trap (see page 338).</p><p>Over time you’ll develop your own events, giving you even more options. Complex Tasks are a great place to experiment with the Fantasy Craft system, as you can test mechanics for just one Challenge attempt without worry that a bad call will have lasting negative impacts on your game.</p><p>Vary the skills and events, playing to the party’s strengths and weaknesses, and don’t stack the odds too heavily for or against them. Look for ways to expand and evolve the Task’s story with each new Challenge or attempt, compounding and raising the stakes. Think of a Complex Task like a riveting sequence in your favorite high adventure movie, when the music swells and the heroes sweat. The best of these sequences periodically introduce new problems to ratchet the tension and keep the audience nervous, but they also throw the heroes a bone every so often to relieve the audience’s pressure. It’s exactly this kind of rollercoaster action that should guide every Complex Task.</p><p>Finally, it’s crucial to plan for any characters who wind up uninvolved in the Task. Concurrent combats are good for this, especially when the Task unfolds round-by-round. Another option is to create a second Task for the rest of the characters to complete. Perhaps they can support the characters attempting the Task with activities on the side (finding gear or information to help them, or preparing a location before the Task moves into it). Maybe the players have something to discuss — a recent plot development or an upcoming plan — while their characters root for the others? They could even make a team check once per attempt to turn their rooting into a morale bonus! The sky’s the limit but the important thing is that everyone have something to do throughout.</p><p>Here are some examples of scripts in action, expanding the ideas in the base Complex Task rules.</p><h3>TASK SCRIPT: THE CLOCKWORK MONSTER</h3><p>In this Progress Task, a massive clockwork automaton is marching toward the heroes’ home village, sent to enact revenge for the party’s efforts against its creator. The party must complete 5 Challenges in 8 rounds, after which the automaton reaches the village and starts destroying buildings. The Task continues even then, until the characters disable the monster, but the village loses a random building for every 3 additional rounds they take.</p><p><strong>Challenge 1 (Acrobatics or Climb DC 20):</strong> With success, an character clambers up and enters the automaton (a grappling hook is especially helpful here, granting a +2 bonus with either check). Each character must attempt this check on his own but all of them may benefit from the same grappling hook. Up to three characters may enter the automaton at once but the rest of the party is still involved; each round they may help clear the village before the automaton arrives (a second Task script could be prepared for this group).</p><p><strong>Challenge 2 (Search DC 18):</strong> With success, this cooperative check lets characters within the automaton find its clockwork heart, a mind-boggling array of tubes, gears, and pistons. This Challenge features no events.</p><p><strong>Challenge 3 (Prestidigitation DC 15):</strong> With success, this cooperative check disables a gear that blocks access to the pistons running the automaton’s legs (the gear is inconsequential otherwise, at least for the purposes of this script). Unfortunately, with failure, the characters attempting the Challenge get caught in the gears instead, suffering 1d8 lethal and 1d6 stress damage each.</p><p><strong>Challenge 4 (Prestidigitation DC 20):</strong> Now that the characters are at the leg pistons, success wreaks havoc with the automaton’s movement. It’s not enough to stop it cold but the metal beast slows, its motion erratic. As a surprise bonus, the characters get 2 additional rounds to complete the Task! Unfortunately, any of them without at least 4 ranks in Acrobatics suffer a –2 penalty due to the automaton’s jerky movement.</p><p>Failure is worse; sections of the automaton’s innards break free, “waking up” to defend it from within. One additional mob of these standard adversaries awakes with each failure (these mobs are equal in number to the characters inside the automaton, not the whole party). The first time they sprout from the surrounding gears they gain a surprise round against the party. They share sentience with the larger monster and go dormant when the Task is won. They have the following statistics.</p><p><strong>Automaton Defenders (Small Construct Walker — 32 XP):</strong> Str 10, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 6, Cha 6; SZ S (Reach 1); Spd 20 ft. ground; Init III; Atk II; Def II; Res IV; Health II; Comp I; Skills: Acrobatics IV, Athletics III; Qualities: Achilles heel (electrical), always ready, damage reduction 1, natural defense</p><p><em>Attack/Weapons:</em> Gear Grind (Slam II: dmg 1d4 lethal; threat 20)</p><p><em>Treasure:</em> None</p><p><strong>Challenge 5 (Prestidigitation DC 25):</strong> The combat continues through this Challenge. With success, the characters finally disable the monstrous automaton and its defenders, but its momentum continues to carry it forward even as its leg gears have locked in place. The automaton tips and collapses, finishing the job. If this is the last round before it reaches the village, it takes out the most outlying building in the process. The fire burning in its crystal eyes dims and the immediate threat is over.</p><p>But what of the heroes within? The last event finds each of them making an Acrobatics check to grab hold of something or dive free as the automaton comes down. With success, a character emerges unscathed but if he fails he suffers 3d6 lethal damage from falling and battering debris.</p><h3>TASK SCRIPT: THE TRAPPED TOMB</h3><p>In this timed Precision Task, the party is trapped inside a tomb that will fill up with poison gas in 10 rounds. The tomb contains the life’s writings of the paranoid architect, who buried clues to escaping throughout his journals. Three successful Investigate checks are required to find and decipher the clues; thereafter, the characters are exposed to concentrated lethal poison once per round until they escape or die.</p><p>The first Challenge is DC 10, the second is DC 15, and the third is DC 20. As an added complication, the Challenges are a linked puzzle and all three must be deciphered correctly in a row; failure with even one leads the characters to the wrong conclusion, resets the process, and opens a random wall panel as shown on Table 7.7: The Trapped Tomb (see below).</p><h4>Table 7.7: The Trapped Tomb</h4><table style=\"text-align:left\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:70px\">d6 Result</th><th>Contents of Panel</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>More gas!

Many are lethal or inflict permanent disabilities, which can easily derail or even end a game without the proper forethought. Always consider whether an antidote is available and if so, who controls it. Compare a disease’s stats against the Fortitude save bonuses of not only the party but important NPCs. Be prepared for the disease to become a primary focus of the players’ attention, and likely that of the local population as well.</p><p>Diseases tend to look and act the same no matter the time period or genre (though in fantasy games their perceived origins are often little more than ludicrous hysteria). Table 7.8 includes a selection of common modern diseases with potential fantasy analogs (see below). Feel free to use these or consider them a guide for your own contagions. You can and should modify save DCs, Incubation Periods, effects, and other details to satisfy the needs of your story. For more information about diseases, see page 216.</p><h4>Table 7.8: Diseases</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Effect</th><th>Incubation</th><th>Possible Fantasy Name and Perceived Origin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Anthrax</td><td>–4 Str, –4 Con</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Herdsman’s curse (spread by animals)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Bubonic plague</td><td>–6 Str, –6 Con</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">The Black Death (spread by monsters)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Dementia</td><td>–4 Int, –4 Cha</td><td>1d6 years</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">The Mumbles (not thought to be a disease but a weakness)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Ebola</td><td>–8 Str, –8 Con</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">The Purple Death (the wrath of the gods)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">E coli</td><td>Sickened for 1 Incubation Period</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Glutton’s pain (punishment for eating too much)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Encephalitis</td><td>–2 Con, –2 Wis</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Brain bugs (tiny insects crawling in the ears and nose)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Flesh-eating virus</td><td>–4 Con</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Mummy rot (see page 276)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Influenza (flu)</td><td>–2 Con</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Traveler’s cough (spread by visitors)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Leprosy</td><td>–2 Dex, –2 Cha</td><td>1d6 years</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">The Slough (comes from consorting with the dead)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Lupus</td><td>–2 Str, –2 Con, –2 Cha</td><td>1d6 years</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">The Wilding (gained in dark forests and secluded locales)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallpox</td><td>–2 Con, –2 Cha</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Pockles (contracted by romancing out of status)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Typhoid fever</td><td>–2 Str, –2 Con</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Thieves’ plague (punishment for stealing)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Yellow fever</td><td>–2 Dex, –2 Con</td><td>1d6 days</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Blood sweats (a sign that the victim has killed before)</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1000000,"name":"XP AND REPUTATION","type":"text","_id":"UAW6tRFOJaYlSgcu","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Experience Points, or “XP,” represent a character’s personal growth — what he takes away from his adventures translated as raw learning. When a character earns enough XP his Career Level rises, many of his statistics improve, and he may apply the level to a class (see page 27). This process is often called “leveling” (e.g. a Level 3 character “levels” when his total XP reaches 5,000). No matter how much XP a character gains, he may only level once per adventure.</p><p>Characters don’t generally earn XP individually but rather gain it as their party completes adventures. This keeps the bookkeeping simple (one XP total for everyone), but it also keeps Career Levels equal, ensuring the characters all have the abilities and raw numbers to stay effective against the same challenges. On occasion, one or more characters may break away from their party, completing objectives and/or defeating adversaries on their own. These characters earn additional XP and if this happens enough they may level ahead of their teammates. In these cases you might want to consider giving the rest of the party a chance to catch up, perhaps with by running additional encounters or even a special adventure just for them.</p><h3>XP REWARDS AND CAREER PACING</h3><p>It’s your job as the GM to determine XP rewards, near the end of building each adventure. XP is awarded for completing objectives (see page 335), encountering traps (see page 338), and defeating adversaries (see page 337). As a rule, the sum of these awards should fall between 750 and 1,000 XP for a single adventure, though you can go as high as 1,500 XP for a truly landmark outing.</p><p>Assuming you stick to these numbers, your party should level approximately once per adventure through Level 5. After that the rate should drop off to about once per two adventures until Level 11, then remain steady at once per three adventures until the late game (Level 17). Four adventures per level common from then until Level 20. Over the course of a character’s entire career, this translates to somewhere between forty and fifty adventures total. For a group that finishes an adventure every two weeks or so, this should result in about two years of play from Level 1 to the pinnacle of heroism.</p><p>Each group is a little different, of course, and these expectations can vary dramatically based on the amount of XP you hand out. More than a couple landmark adventures and your group will pull ahead; more than a few low-yield outings and your group will take longer to cap out. If you’re looking for another way to speed up leveling, consider the fast levels campaign quality (see page 323).</p><h3>APPLYING XP</h3><p>XP can be awarded at the end of each scene or at the end of each adventure, as your group prefers. Awarding XP by scene gives the characters the chance to level during an adventure but it may also slow the game down as players make choices for their new levels. Especially if this is your first time roleplaying, we recommend awarding XP by adventure so everyone can take the time they need.</p><p>Whenever you apply XP, it must first be multiplied by the adventure’s Threat Level, including any adjustments from Menace (see page 334). The result is added to each character’s total.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A party of five characters Levels 4, 7, 9, 10, and 18 (TL 9) completes an adventure with a total base reward of 800 XP. The adventure’s Menace is IV (Dangerous), which increases the TL by 2 (to 11). Each character gains 8,800 XP.</p><p>If any characters have fallen 2 or more levels behind the others, consider giving them a bonus of 10–25% of their adventure XP (to help them catch up). You should only do this if the player is present for the whole adventure and contributes frequently and positively.</p><blockquote><h3>PLAYING WITHOUT EXPERIENCE</h3><p>If you find tracking XP tedious, consider playing without it. Just decide when you want the characters to level: per the story (after important or defining adventures, for example); after a set number of adventures; or when the group decides they want a little more variety.</p><p>This approach is tricky, as you need to plan ahead (past the next adventure), develop a formula that works for your group, or stay on top of it with your players, asking every adventure or two if they’re still having fun at their current level. Regardless of the method you choose, you should always keep characters at the same level when playing without experience.</p></blockquote><h2>REPUTATION</h2><p>Reputation basics are covered in Chapter 4 (see page 186). Characters earn Reputation in two ways.</p><p>• Each character earns Reputation when his party completes an adventure, as shown on Table 7.9: Adventure Reputation (see page 343). His Legend is added to this total (see page 29). This reward is fixed and requires no special preparation.</p><p>• The party or an individual character may earn Reputation as an Instant Reward (see page 344).</p><p>In both cases this Reputation signifies word spreading about the character and/or party’s exploits. You can portray this in play by having shop keeps, tavern masters, squires, town criers, and others bring it up, even if they don’t recognize the characters (see page 187). The greater the Menace, the more spectacular the stories should be. Remember also that gossip tends to warp the facts over time — you can and should see the characters’ saga shift as it passes from one NPC to the next.</p><h4>Table 7.9: Adventure Reputation</h4><table style=\"text-align:left\"><thead><tr><th>Menace</th><th>Reputation Reward *</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>I</td><td>2 + Legend</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>5 + Legend</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>10 + Legend</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>15 + Legend</td></tr><tr><td>V</td><td>20 + Legend</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>REPUTATION PENALTIES</h3><p>Characters can also hurt their Reputation by betraying their public allies and values. Word tends to spread even more quickly when a nominally heroic party sacrifices or lets innocents come to harm, even in order to win the day. No one trusts heroes that lie, steal, or cheat, and no one hires characters — even mercenary or villainous ones — who ignore job instructions.</p><p>When building an adventure, consider also how the characters might injure their Reputation: actions they might take to disappoint friends, employers, and others who rely on them. Just a few representing the most egregious offenses is plenty. Avoid minor slights, as they’re not worthy of Reputation loss.</p><p>Assign each offence a penalty of –1 to –3 Reputation. The combined total from all offences in each adventure should be no higher than –10 Reputation. These penalties are applied simultaneously with Adventure Reputation and may reduce a character’s Reputation to less than he had before. If they drop his Reputation to less than 0, his Reputation resets to 0 and his Renown in the most appropriate track drops by 1. This may have additional impacts, such as forcing the character to give up a Prize.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Lord Bloodpyre, leader of the bloodthirsty orc tribes of the Vile Wash, honors a debt he’s owed for years by letting a caravan pass through the tribe lands without paying tribute. Despite the fact that he treated the caravan with fairness (and potentially earned Reputation for doing so), he betrayed his tribe, triggering one of the game’s longstanding Reputation penalties.</p><p>Indeed, Lord Bloodpyre has shown kindness several times recently and his Reputation is flagging as a result. This latest offence drops his Reputation to –2, so he loses 1 Noble Renown (the GM decides that his peoples’ doubt is most fiercely leveled at his ability to lead). Lord Bloodpyre is at his Prize Limit, so he must also lose one of those. He chooses Bwarg the Goblin King, a contact and leader of an allied humanoid tribe. He’s had a shaky relationship with Bwarg for some months now; after this, he shouldn’t expect any support from the tiny quivering ones.</p><p>You may inform the players of potential Reputation penalties ahead of play or let them discover them as they commit their corresponding offences. The offences should be clear from the outset, however, preferably explained as part of the story or through NPC dialog (e.g. “Lord Bloodpyre, your continued mercy tries our patience.”).</p><h3>INSTANT REWARDS</h3><p>Some actions are immediately memorable and some stories change a character’s life forever. A hero is remembered for a daring and spectacular stunt, an ally is won with a single momentous decision, a debt of honor is offered for particular kindness, an unexpected inheritance leaves a character with an impressive family homestead, or a title is bestowed for an act so courageous that nothing short of a new name will do. All these are examples of “Instant Rewards,” or awards of Reputation or Prizes earned immediately for pre-scripted actions and decisions in play.</p><p>Instant Rewards are built into adventures. They’re a bit like objectives but pay off immediately in the form of 1–3 Reputation (for exciting, cinematic, and innovative actions) or a single Prize (when appropriate to the story). It’s helpful to prepare one or two of these in each adventure, especially if any “pop out” at you as you build the story and apply the rules. You can also award them on the fly (with no preparation), and in both cases they work the same.</p><p>• The reward is immediately applied to the character’s sheet.</p><p>• If the reward is a Prize and it takes the character over his Prize Limit, he must refuse it or sacrifice one of his other Prizes at the end of the adventure.</p><p>Instant Reputation Rewards are fairly trivial but Instant Prizes can sometimes rankle the other players. You should keep track of which characters receive them and make sure to compensate the other characters as soon as you can, perhaps with their own Instant Prizes, boosted Renown, more story focused on their characters, bonus action dice, fortuitous Favors, or useful gear. In groups where this is likely to become an issue, it’s probably also a good idea to avoid individual Instant Prizes whenever possible, instead awarding them to the whole party (e.g. a grateful patron leaves them his estate when he dies, for example, or they’re all knighted at once).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1100000,"name":"TREASURE","type":"text","_id":"7rcD5MSzv4BB92d6","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Treasure basics are explained as part of NPC construction (see page 239).

The hobgoblins all share the same statistics, which include a treasure entry of “1C, 1G.” The party makes 1 Coin roll and 1 Gear roll for the entire camp.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A hobgoblin chieftain with separate statistics and his pet warg are also located at the camp. Defeating them generates separate rolls even if they share the same treasure entry because they have different statistics. In this case the GM has assigned the same treasure code to the chieftain but only 1T to the warg. Assuming the party defeats everything in the camp they make 2 Coin rolls and 2 Gear rolls (for the hobgoblins and the chieftan), and 1 Trophy roll (for the warg).</p><p>For each Treasure Roll, the party rolls 1d20, adding the NPC’s Threat Level and any relevant modifiers from Table 7.10: Treasure Roll Modifiers (see page 345). Find the result on the appropriate treasure table (7.11–7.16) to learn what the characters recover.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Following the first of the two previous examples, Brungil’s party consists of 5 characters (including him) and the Threat Level is 8. For each Treasure Roll, the party totals 1d20 + 8 (the TL) + 5 (because the hobgoblins are in their lair) + 15 (because the NPCs outnumber the party by 4-to-1 (20 vs. 5). Thus, each Treasure Roll is 1d20 + 28.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Following the second of the two previous examples, each Treasure Roll remains 1d20 + 28 unless the TL changes, as the NPCs are still located in their lair and they outnumber Brungil’s party by the same ratio. If there were 4 wargs instead of 1, the ratio would rise to 5-to-1, making each roll 1d20 + 33.</p><h3>PRESET TREASURE</h3><p>Of course, the GM can feature specific treasure in an adventure anytime he likes. This allows him to carefully control the rate at which the party acquires wealth and has the added benefit of tailoring treasure precisely to each encounter. When the GM assigns treasure, he should reduce the adversaries’ treasure codes accordingly.</p><p>Artifacts, in particular, make good candidates for preset treasure. Though it’s (remotely) possible to randomly roll one on the treasure tables, the Game Master is strongly advised to build them into adventures, preferably one at a time, making each a capstone reward for monumental success (e.g. defeating the Big Bad in a campaign, preventing the destruction of a region, etc.).</p><p></p><h4>Table 7.10: Treasure Roll Modifiers</h4><table

It may be separated at the same rate as clearing rubble (see page 154).</p><p><strong>Special Note on Loot Value</strong></p><p>The values of loot rise at higher results but the types, weights, and quantities generally don’t. This is because loot spans a broad range of quality — not all diamonds shine with the same luster, nor do all crops or works of art demand the same price. As with many treasure results, specific flavor is left to the GM and the group to allow for varied and setting-specific details. A more valuable diamond might be slightly larger, for example, or it might be uncut. Crops with a higher silver value might have been grown in particularly rich soil and greater art might have been created by an accomplished or aspiring master.</p><p><strong>Optional Detail</strong></p><p>Other Loot as Raw Materials: The raw materials entries represent various resources that are especially well suited to crafting, often because they’ve already been prepped in some fashion (treated wood, polished stone, etc.). With the GM’s permission, however, a character might be able to use some other loot as raw materials (e.g. wood trade goods in carpentry). In such cases, the materials are worth 1/2 their normal loot value as raw materials, rounded down (e.g. 120s in wood trade goods is worth 60s as carpentry raw materials). Supply and Demand: The value of loot can shift significantly depending on area, season, how much is being brought in and sold, and many other factors. Listed values are the highest the party will see but the GM can vary them by rating demand and supply each on a scale of 1–10, subtracting supply from demand, and multiplying the result by 10. This becomes a percentage applied to the listed value.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM determines that hides are in high demand (because people are stocking up for winter) but that few are coming in (due to dwindling animal populations in the area). He rates demand as 8 and supply as 2, for a result of 6 (+60% of listed value). Thus a stack of hides listed at 300s would actually be worth 480s on the open market.</p><p>This rule could actually be applied to any treasure, or indeed any gear, but it’s most appropriate for loot.</p><h4>Table 7.15: Magic</h4><table style=\"text-align:left\"><thead><tr><th>Result</th><th>Treasure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>1 Level 0 scroll (roll on Table 3.2:

The thieves were instructed to destroy the item but instead sold it, leaving a chance,however slim, that its purpose may yet be fulfilled. <br /><em>Example: </em>It was made for the Patron Saint of Adventure, who is long gone but watches over those bold few exploring the fringes of society. Followers claim that the Saint’s gear conveys a potent blessing but is also a sign of impending desperate need. <br /><em>Example: </em>It was fixed in the earth where the last of the elder titans, progenitors of mortal man, perished. So long as it remained there the titans would slumber, leaving their descendants to their fate. Perhaps that explains the tremors of late…</p></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><p>The item hails from a previous age. <br /><em>Example: </em>When it was constructed to aid a party of adventurers in vanquishing a vicious beast. The creature’s blood stains the item but it’s visible only under moonlight, when a Resurrection III spell can be cast on the item to bring the beast back. <br /><em>Example: </em>When its presence comforted a dying queen in the twilight of her empire. It can do the same for party members, healing 1d6 stress damage each night it remains within a few feet of a slumbering character. Anyone healed in this fashion wakes from dreams of pleasant conversations about the world that was, and the dark forces that undermined it — forces that loom again. <br /><em>Example: </em>Or rather, its previous age. The item travels backward through time, coincidentally taking its owners along for the ride.</p></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><p>The item… isn’t an item. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s a wounded mimic that’s lost the ability to shapeshift. The characters could kill it or sell it to an apothecary — or they could nurse it back to health, gaining a free Animal Partner (see page 108). <br /><em>Example: </em>It was given physical shape by the fever-dreams of an ailing sorcerer, and it’s just one (rather benign) invention; unless the sorcerer is cured, and quickly, his nightmares might soon follow. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s a concealed construct sent out into the world by an aging inventor looking for worthy heirs to his collection of oddities. If the party proves it can treat gear with respect, perhaps the construct will lead them back to its creator.</p></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><p>The item features sockets or other crevasses. <br /><em>Example: </em>The sockets are custom-made for a series of magically charged gems, each held by a predatory collector or monster. <br /><em>Example: </em>The sockets are mouths that feed on fear, regret, and other negative emotions. This can be helpful, as it renders the party immune to stress damage. Of course, they aren’t alone — everyone near the item is immune, including enemies. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item is a key, fitting perfectly into the belly of an iron maiden. Learning the item’s true purpose is hollow consolation however, when the torture device takes on the form of an actual maiden, a battle-maiden cursed centuries ago for war crimes. She plucks the name of the party’s greatest foe from their minds and sets out on a crusade to destroy the enemy, leaving a gory trail of massacred innocents in her wake.</p></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><p>The item is… odd. <br /><em>Example: </em>No matter how much damage it takes, it’s always in perfect shape in the morning. If only the same could be said for whatever it sits on overnight. Everything beneath it crumbles to dust and the earth below turns black. Days later, perhaps long after the party has moved on, the charred earth cracks open and spews forth imps and other outsiders elated to finally be free. <br /><em>Example: </em>If the party were to crack the item open they’d find flesh and bone… Where did it all come from? <br /><em>Example: </em>The item’s an illusion projected from its actual location — in the heart of an enemy camp.</p></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><p>The item is part of a set. <br /><em>Example: </em>The full set awakens a powerful force or unlocks a secret location <br /><em>Example: </em>The full set grants membership in an organization and special training (apply the Mentor/Patron Subplot) <br /><em>Example: </em>The full set animates and serves its owner(s) as simple, non-combatant custodians. They cook, clean, and amuse.</p></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><p>The item is made from an unusual material. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s composed of an element (air, earth, fire, or water) and can be used once per day to cast any spell of that element up to Level 2. Unfortunately, its use is taxing and inflicts 1d6 subdual damage. It must also be recharged once per year at a remote elemental temple guarded by a fungoid demon queen. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s made with the harvested bits of a particular species (roll on Table 7.17). Its kin want the remains back, plus one or two of the new owners to make some items of their own. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s made of solid sound and emits a constant, low hum. It works just as it’s supposed to until a louder sound drowns it out, at which point it disappears until the louder sound is gone.</p></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><p>The item bears a unique crest or other identifying mark. <br /><em>Example: </em>The mark is a unique piece of art commissioned to celebrate the love between a high-ranking noble and his beautiful bride. Should the party return the item to the couple, the noble promises them a free Favor (up to Noble Renown 7). <br /><em>Example: </em>Though it may not be immediately obvious, the mark depicts a location — from another location. At the second location is a burial site where the artist’s body lies, along with his greatest masterpiece. <br /><em>Example: </em>The mark belongs to the item’s long-dead maker. He was widely regarded as one of the foremost in his craft and if the party can find his hidden workshop and decipher his personal code, they just might learn from him (i.e. gain +5 ranks in Crafting).</p></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><p>The item is central to a prophecy (apply the Chosen Subplot). <br /><em>Example: </em>“The fallen shall rise and the risen shall fall. So the cycle has been and so the cycle must be.” <br /><em>Example: </em>“To his earth place the Wood of N’gai, wither may come He Who is Not to be Named.” <br /><em>Example: </em>“And a band of heroes shall discover the vessel and bear witness to the last gasp of their world.”</p></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><p>The item is haunted by one or more ghosts or other spirits (apply the Haunted Subplot). <br /><em>Example: </em>The spirits are victims of the previous owner and seek to scour all trace of him from the world — including the item. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item is haunted by a single spirit, a former storyteller who never penned a great adventure epic. With the help of a friendly witchdoctor, the storyteller bound his spirit to the item, hoping it would fall into the hands of a band of heroes. Now… it has, and the spirit harangues the party with questions about their plans, histories, and escapades. <br /><em>Example: </em>The spirit was killed by its shrewish spouse (who now lives in their luxurious home with a new lover). If the party helps to resolve the situation so the spirit can pass on, it leads them to the home’s hidden deed (so they can claim it as a free Holding).</p></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><p>The item is hollow (apply the hollow upgrade). <br /><em>Example: </em>It was made to smuggle items past port officials and city guards — items like the small vial of clear fluid the party finds inside. Maybe the liquid’s part of a vile alchemical concoction or maybe, just maybe, it’s the only cure for a terrible malady. <br /><em>Example: </em>Anything put in the item disappears, replaced with something entirely different. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item contains a vermin nest and the critters aren’t happy about losing their home. They follow the party, seeking to steal the item back. Should combat ensue, the vermin share statistics with any random critter (roll on Table 7.17).</p></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><p>The item is stolen. <br /><em>Example: </em>Or so it would seem. The item’s actually a copy of the original, which is in the possession of the counterfeiter. <br /><em>Example: </em>It was stolen from a widespread and pervasive cult with its eyes on the throne. It’s one of many items that can be activated with a unique code phrase to communicate with, or observe, other spies and saboteurs working for the cult. <br /><em>Example: </em>It was stolen from a prestigious religious museum. If returned, the party gains 5 Heroic Renown.</p></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><p>The item was involved in recent events. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item is pivotal in a war or political crisis (apply the Military/Political Entanglement Subplot) <br /><em>Example: </em>The item has been demanded as ransom by a shadowy group that kidnapped a wealthy family’s firstborn son. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item was used in a murder and can be used to identify the killer. The owner gains the Hunted Subplot as the killer tries to eliminate the lead. If a witness or a local constable sees the owner with the item, he also gains the Wanted Subplot.</p></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><p>The item contains or bears a map or clues leading to a location. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item was stolen from the location, a crypt containing the spoils of a long-dead adventuring party. They hunted and killed the thief, then returned to the location to guard the spoils of their long career together. <br /><em>Example: </em>A captive is held at the location. If freed, he becomes a new Contact for the party at no cost. <br /><em>Example: </em>At the location, the item can become anything the party wants it to be, but only for the next 24 hours, and only so long as it stays in their possession. After that, the item vanishes.</p></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><p>The item is famous. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s also ostentatious, immediately identifying the party wherever they go, and automatically shifting initial Dispositions by 1d20 for or against them. <br /><em>Example: </em>As a vessel of ultimate destruction. Though it may be harmless now, people still avoid its presence and speak of it in hushed tones. <br /><em>Example: </em>As part of a carnival act or stage play that brought great joy for generations. Everywhere the party goes they hear new stories.</p></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><p>The item was forged by the divine (randomly determine the item’s Alignment from those available in the setting). <br /><em>Example: </em>It also opposes the arcane, any spell use within 30 ft. of it triggering an Anti-Magic Field I spell centered on its location. <br /><em>Example: </em>It “records” events and can be tapped to learn about the surrounding area’s past. The events unfold like memories and become part of the viewer’s recollections, which can be confusing to the uninitiated. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item is a magnet for situations best solved by acting in accordance with its Alignment. If the party uses these tactics 3 or more times they gain the item’s Alignment or (if they have an incompatible Alignment) suffer a Crisis of Faith Subplot.</p></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><p>The item changes shape and function once a day at a random time (roll on the “Any” treasure table for daily forms). <br /><em>Example: </em>It takes the form of an object within 1 mile held by a person in profound emotional turmoil. <br /><em>Example: </em>The item is a construct familiar cursed by its spiteful former master. It tries to communicate with the party (e.g. forming words on its surface, making repetitive or suggestive sounds, etc.) and begs for their help in killing its master and lifting the curse. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s part of a grand bet staged by a trickster demigod and his orderly father. Each new form is crucial to solving a problem that crops up in the area. If the party figures it out and solves enough of the problems the father wins the bet and the trickster withdraws for 20 years; otherwise his father does. Either way the item vanishes.</p></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><p>The item is cursed (apply the Cursed Subplot). <br /><em>Example: </em>It periodically invokes fear in those the party meets (possibly by warping their appearance in the minds of observers). <br /><em>Example: </em>The item teleports the party to a random location once per day. <br /><em>Example: </em>It saps the party’s life force, increasing incoming damage by 1 point per injury.</p></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><p>The item is intelligent (Int and Wis 1d8+10 each + telepathic quality) <br /><em>Example: </em>It wants to be returned to its previous owner and does everything it can to leave a trail for him to follow. <br /><em>Example: </em>It’s been around long enough to become jaded and delights in ribbing the party every chance it gets. It would be easy to just chuck it into a pit or sell it for scrap — if it weren’t so damned helpful the rest of the time. <br /><em>Example: </em>It animates when the party sleeps and/or leaves, destroying pieces of other gear out of jealousy.</p></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Game Master Fiat</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>RAW MATERIALS</h2><p>Certain Loot and Trophy results include raw materials, which can be used in Crafting (see page 72). After an encounter, a party may also want to scavenge the area for more (e.g. prying metal and stone from fixtures, rendering animals for bones and hide, ripping apart location traps, tearing down structures, etc.). This is especially true if the game is entering Downtime.</p><p>No skill check is required. A character simply spends the required time and gains the listed silver piece value in raw materials, as shown on Table 7.19: Scavenging Raw Materials (see below).</p><p>An item or patch of scenery may be scavenged by no more than 1/4 the characters who can stand on, in, or adjacent to it, rounded up (they need the extra room to work). Each time the number of characters scavenging an item or patch of scenery doubles, the time required drops by 1/2 (rounded up).</p><p><em>Example:</em> Though nine characters may stand adjacent to a Medium marble statue, only three may scavenge it. When three characters work together, the time to scavenge the statue decreases to 1 hour (from 2 hours).</p><p>Scavenged materials may only be applied to certain Crafting projects (by Crafting focus), as defined by the GM when they’re acquired. Raw materials weigh 1/10 their silver value in pounds (rounded up).</p><p>Only ruined items and scenery (including location traps) may be scavenged, and can only be scavenged once. Working and broken gear may be Dismantled with similar results (see page 73).</p><p></p><h4>Table 7.19: Scavenging Raw Materials</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Ruined Item/Scenery Size</th><th>Time Required</th><th>Raw Materials Scavenged</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Diminutive *</td><td>15 minutes</td><td>1s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Tiny</td><td>30 minutes</td><td>2s × average Crafting</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Small</td><td>1 hour</td><td>5s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Medium</td><td>2 hours</td><td>10s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Large</td><td>6 hours</td><td>25s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Huge</td><td>1 day</td><td>100s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Gargantuan</td><td>1 week</td><td>200s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Colossal</td><td>1 month</td><td>500s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Enormous</td><td>2 months</td><td>1,000s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Vast</td><td>6 months</td><td>2,500s × average Crafting bonus</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Smaller items and scenery cannot be scavenged.</p><h2>CAMPAIGNS</h2><p>In a campaign, adventures are run in succession, each a new episode in a continuing story. The same rules for developing an adventure story can apply to a campaign, producing an opening adventure, closing adventure, and many installments in-between, though if a campaign goes on long enough you may want to consider breaking your campaign into seasons, each with its own premiere and finale (just like a U.S. TV season or British series).</p><p>Campaigns usually feature recurring themes and concepts, which can be supported mechanically with campaign qualities (see page 322). They sometimes also invoke a particular flavor, like horror, swashbuckling, wuxia, or one of the genres described on page 305, for which qualities are also a good fit.</p><p>Thanks to the Menace and scaling rules, you can start a campaign at any Career Level without modifying your adventures. Just set each character’s XP to the minimum required for the desired level and dive into the action!</p><h3>CAMPAIGN LENGTH</h3><p>It’s almost always a good idea to plan for the end of your campaign before it begins. This supports the overall structure of a campaign, helping you plan for the closing adventure as you move through the opening and middle ones. It allows proper foreshadowing and helps you set an appropriate pace every step of the way.</p><p>Unless you’re lucky enough to have a play group without many commitments, it’s best to plan for a window of opportunity (e.g. a summer vacation, a school year, or the duration of the “slow months” at work). Once you know how many sessions you can play, build adventures to span half of them. Assume the rest will be consumed by schedule conflicts, illness, unexpected work nights, and other life issues. Plus, if you actually manage to play through them all, you get a bonus campaign!</p><h3>ADVENTURE PLAY VS. UNBROKEN PLAY</h3><p>Campaigns can unfold in two ways — as a series of discreet episodes (each an adventure) or as an ongoing game with no perceptible breaks (this is common when the party controls the direction of the campaign, deciding what parts of the world to explore and what rumors and events to pursue). The former option changes nothing about the game but the latter raises an important question.</p><h4>WHEN DO ABILITIES AND TIMERS REFRESH?</h4><p>Per adventure abilities and timers refresh after an arbitrary number of sessions you define (we recommend three). Per scene and per session abilities and timers are unchanged (you should still play with scenes and encounters, even if you abandon the full adventure format).</p><h4>PAYING THE BILLS</h4><p>Fortunately, this isn’t an issue. Each character’s upkeep — including the rental of inn rooms and other general travel costs — is folded into Prudence (see page 153).</p><h3>CONTINUITY</h3><p>One of the most important decisions you can make when building a campaign is the frequency and magnitude of recurring locations, NPCs, adversaries, and stories. There’s no right answer — old faces and places can appear in every installment or become major events. If your campaign revolves an arch-villain and his legions, then your course is probably set, at least toward the end of the campaign, but otherwise you can link as often as feels right.</p><p>The one, all-important watchword of campaign continuity — and indeed, adventure continuity as well — is consistency. No matter how often you include locations, characters, and stories, never contradict what’s come before without an extremely well-considered reason. Permanent physical injuries, intense prejudices, family ties, and irrefutable truths witnessed by large crowds are all campaign truths and shouldn’t be sacrificed for anything short of a game-changing revelation.</p><h3>PLAYER PACKS AND CAMPAIGN LOGS</h3><p>When prepping a campaign, you might find it helpful to develop a player pack, which presents the campaign concept and many world details such as important locations and NPCs, religions and myths, rumors, and general character knowledge. A player pack can also list possible character roles, available character options (if less than the full offering), anticipated goals, and expected behavior. This document can be a great asset, establishing an accepted baseline out the gate, and can help to keep everyone on the same page throughout the campaign.</p><p>Another helpful document is your campaign log, which is simply a list of important notes that grows as you develop new information for the game. It can be used to remember character and location names you come up with on the fly, house rules, ideas for upcoming sessions that come to you during play, and more. Over time you’ll develop your own organization for this but to start we recommend Characters, Places, Miscellaneous, Rules, and Ideas.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1200000,"name":"RUNNING FANTASY CRAFT","type":"text","_id":"oQHqF0u4UbUl2ame","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Building worlds and adventures is only half your job — the rest is the business of promoting fun, making rules calls, and keeping the party and story moving forward. It’s not easy. Running an RPG requires you to be equal parts team manager and stage director. You have to make decisions quickly and confidently, present ideas clearly and concisely, and be ready to improvise when the unexpected happens (and the unexpected will happen — it always happens).</p><p>Fortunately, the rewards are substantial: as a creator you see your vision realized more directly and intimately than any script writer or novelist; as an entertainer you enjoy a more immediate and interactive response from the “audience” than any actor on stage or screen; and as a judge you have complete control over an entire universe of places, characters, and events. It’s your show — though you still have to make sure the players are happy in it. Let’s start there, with your role at the table.</p><h2>THE IMPARTIAL CHAMPION</h2><p>The first thing to remember as Game Master is that you’re the voice of success and failure. In order to remain equal and impartial in all things, you must remain positive and avoid bias at all times. You can’t give in to anger, resentment, or spite, or let any players’ negative emotions undermine your confidence and positive outlook, lest the whole game be dragged down with you.</p><p>When you remain level-headed and fair, and ensure your world and NPCs never strain credibility or take advantage of the party, there’s no limit to your potential.</p><h3>FUN FIRST</h3><p>People play games for a reason: because they’re fun. In this game, you’re the conductor of fun. You write the chords and look for harmony with your players. If one of them falls out of tune, it’s your responsibility to guide him back, hopefully without losing the others.</p><p>You have many tools at your disposal: a deep understanding of your story (and hopefully the game rules), insights about what your players enjoy, improvisational skill, and a sense of humor. Make the most of these and keep an eye out for disengaged or distracted players. They’re the ones who need your attention the most.</p><h3>LEAD BY EXAMPLE</h3><p>Players also expect you to set the tone. If your NPCs are ruthless and adversarial, then they’ll return the favor. If the challenges are relentless or exceedingly difficult, they’ll start playing against you rather than their foes. Keep your game grave but not grim, challenging but not cruel, honor the characters in success and defeat, and the players will rise to every occasion</p><h2>DEVELOPING YOUR STYLE</h2><p>Over time, you’ll develop your own personal GMing style. You might become a dedicated roleplayer, indulging in heavy drama and serious stakes, or you might run a “beer and pretzels” game that lets everyone goof off and laugh as much as they want, no matter what’s going on in the story. You might be committed to using the rules “properly,” or prefer a fast-andloose method where anything that isn’t essential to the core game is ignored or decided on the fly. All these options are equally valid ways to play the game but the only style that really matters is yours.</p><p>So what sort of GM are you? If you’ve never run before, you might not know. Taking a cue from Alignments (see page 308), a Good GM might enable the players and story, cutting the heroes slack so long as the adventure advances and everyone has a good time, while an Evil GM might delight in foiling the players’ best-laid plans, cooking up conniving plots and dastardly monsters to use against them. An Orderly GM might stick to the rules closely, keeping the game fair and “by the book” at all times, while a Chaotic GM might pitch the rules out the window the first time they interfere with his next move.</p><p>Most GMs are a blend of these. They champion and discard the rules as needed to keep the game fair and entertaining, and balance their adversarial and supportive roles to make sure the players usually win, though not always easily.</p><h3>ROLE-PLAYING VS. ROLL-PLAYING</h3><p>Roleplaying games are improvised theatre presented as a tactical exercise, play-acting governed by percentages, averages, and bell-curves. Like players, most GMs lean either towards roleplaying (focusing on story, character development, and plot) or “roll-playing” (focusing more on tactical elements, rules, and combat). Both options have advantages and pitfalls. Immersing the players too heavily in roleplay can leave character statistics unused (wasting the time spent choosing them), but rolling the dice for every action eliminates the human element, denying the PCs one of the greatest weapons in their arsenal — the players’ instinct and problem solving ability.</p><p>Your approach should depend partially on the nature of your group but striving for a balance is helpful in most cases. Injecting opportunities for emotional and character investment between exciting fights (or vice-versa) should keep everyone interested and engaged.</p><h3>HISTORY VS. FANTASY</h3><p>Many fantasy games are set in the real world, or a world very close to ours: Ancient Greece and China, feudal Europe and Japan, the age of the Vikings and even the dawn of man are all popular choices. A real-world analog can provide a valuable touchstone for culture, technology, NPC details, and more, but it can also lead to problems if one or more players (including you) disagree about how rigidly to adhere to the record. If you embrace history at all, be sure to discuss your plans with the group and come to a consensus before you start the game. Ask history and fantasy enthusiasts their opinion directly, as they’re the most likely to take issue with any conflicts they see, which can stall the game and cause unwanted friction.</p><h3>REALISM VS. PLAUSIBILITY</h3><p>Another balance to consider is that of what’s possible in the real world vs. what’s possible in your game. This being a fantasy RPG, magic and miracles can explain virtually anything, no matter how unrealistic or even implausible it is. Again, however, it’s important to get all the players on the same page. As with history vs. fantasy, your GMing style needs to support the group’s common preference.</p><h3>BE FLEXIBLE</h3><p>No matter how much your group discusses the game beforehand, and no matter how hard you work to develop a matching GM style, surprises will abound. You might find that the historical precedents the group’s so fiercely committed to including produce too staid a setting, or that you have to make things up when you’re all stumped about details, only to find you rather enjoy the result. You might initially want to keep the rules in the background, only to find everyone picking up the dice at every available opportunity. These aren’t failures to implement a plan but rather signs that the plan might not actually be what you’re after.</p><p>Remember, there are no right ways to play an RPG and every group must find its own happy medium (even if it’s not really a medium at all!). In the end you should do what feels right and run for your group, being open to new options and styles as they present themselves.</p><h2>WORKING WITH THE PLAYERS</h2><p>One of your most important duties is managing the player dynamic, which boils down to entertaining the group, keeping their trust, and treating them with respect. Don’t speak down to them, or make them feel dense for not “getting” the world or the adventure. Never make them feel like your job is more important than theirs — in fact, do exactly the opposite by keeping them at the center of the action except when you have to pass along vital details.</p><p>This isn’t as difficult or selfless as it sounds. Every RPG revolves around the players and it’s simple to apply this mindset to everything you do. Though your actions frequently “oppose” the player characters, every adventure you design, every monster you build, every decision you make, and every unexpected twist you conceive — it’s all there to entertain the players, your friends.</p><p>Experienced GMs know to let the players take charge every so often, especially with things that aren’t pivotal to the plot. Not only does it draw the players deeper into the campaign, it makes your job easier as well.</p><h3>CHALLENGING THE HEROES</h3><p>No party appreciates what it doesn’t earn. Part of being a fair and impartial GM is making sure the party works hard for its successes — at least as hard as you work to provide the evening’s adventure. Trial breeds triumph, and triumph breeds commitment to the setting, the storyline, and its creator. Make them sweat and at the end of the day their reward will taste twice as sweet.</p><p>Challenges are many and varied, and not all must involve combat. Tough moral and ethical choices, cerebral trials like puzzles and tactical exercises, and even intense debates — especially in character — can be just as stimulating, and offer their own unique rewards to boot.</p><h3>MAKING RULES CALLS</h3><p>No RPG can account for every possible situation, which is one of the reasons for a GM. You’re the final arbiter when the rules fall short of exactly handling the action. Your call is the last word and so you need to ensure your rulings are both fair and best for the situation at hand. Consider the effects of every ruling: What other rules and character options might be affected? Will the ruling change anything about the world and adventure? Perhaps most importantly, how will the players react?</p><p>With the right answer in hand — a ruling that’s fair and promotes fun — present it evenly and dispassionately. A cavalier, argumentative, or dictatorial ruling can cause resentment and may also provoke the players to argue. Your goal when making a ruling is to avoid debate or, failing that, to keep them as brief and concise as possible. Letting the game grind to a halt over a single rule helps no one. When in doubt, make the best call you can and let everyone know you’d like to discuss it after the session.</p><p>Remain as consistent as possible when revising and applying rules — the players rely on them to make important decisions, during and between games. If you change your mind about a previous ruling, give the players ample warning so they can raise any questions as needed.</p><h3>LISTEN TO THE PLAYERS</h3><p>One of the best things you can do for your game is listen to the players. Constantly. Never assume the game is working for them — not even if it was a month ago. Even if you talk to your players all the time, periodically start or end your session with a quick request for feedback, and preferably a few pointed questions. Have they particularly enjoyed or disliked anything about the game lately? Have they seen any movies or read any books they’d recommend as inspiration? Is there something they want out of the game that they’re not getting?</p><p>You can also use this opportunity to get to know the characters. What’s the heroes’ take on recent events in the game? What do they want and how do they intend to get it? Who do they see as their biggest allies and threats? Are there plot threads the heroes want to resolve?</p><p>The answers should provide valuable insight and may spark ideas to keep the group interested. You don’t have to give up your goals for the story, so long as you’re incorporating the players’ desires as well. Let them have a say and they’ll keep coming back week after week, with dice in hand and smiles on their faces.</p><h3>INVEST IN THE CHARACTERS</h3><p>Players like to see their characters grow, on and off their record sheets, and elevating a hero beyond the stats — expanding on his background, aspirations, foibles, and triumphs — can dramatically increase a player’s stock in the game. He’ll be ecstatic to see his contacts blossom into recurring NPCs the party can rely on in perilous adventures, and won’t even mind when old foes return, looking for revenge. He’ll thank you for periodically adding new details about his improving lifestyle, embellishing on shiny new possessions and holdings, and coming up with inventive honorifics for NPCs to bestow upon him when they meet.</p><p>Of course, character development is a joint effort. You can certainly get the ball rolling — by incorporating character background into the next adventure, for example, or setting a scene in one of the characters’ homes — but after that you should encourage the players to be just as involved. The very best campaigns are forged when creative people work together to make them a reality.</p><h3>REWARD FAILURE</h3><p>One of the most direct ways to get the players involved is to reward their efforts (not necessarily their successes — those are usually reward enough). Here’s an example: a burglar suffers an error when scaling a castle wall. You could spend action dice to trigger a critical failure, having the hero fall noisily and alert the royal guards, but that would penalize the player for doing what he’s built to do. Instead, you could ignore the roll and let the character try again (or better yet, not call for the roll in the first place). After all, the burglar is doing something he’s trained for… Why not just let the player describe how he does it, especially if the roll isn’t crucial to the adventure’s success?</p><p>If you’re a stickler for random happenstance, use unlucky results to introduce moments of tension. Using the previous example, the burglar might barely catch himself, three fingers on a window ledge, as guards pass below. The window opens and a curious woman arches her eyebrow at the burglar, clearly amused. This puts the burglar in a more desperate position that doesn’t rely on the same skill(s) as before. It raises the stakes and forces him to think on his feet. It also gives him new things to do rather than merely asking him for another identical roll. Who knows? Perhaps the burglar will discover his inner lothario and not only turn the situation around but come out ahead.</p><h3>THE FIRM HAND</h3><p>There are two very important exceptions to the “kid gloves” approach. First, any player who repeatedly and intentionally acts to the detriment of the group, ruining everyone’s fun, demands a swift and strong response. If the problem involves his character’s in-game actions (e.g. he’s abusing allies or being unnecessarily violent), NPC reactions might be enough to bring him in line. Failing that, calm observations may be required and if the problem still persists, you might have to make an appointment to speak with the troublemaker away from the group. Never lose your composure in situations like this. Remain focused on the problem and resolved that the player needs to adjust his behavior. Explain that if he doesn’t improve he’ll be politely asked to leave the game.</p><p>The second instance is an adventure’s climax, when everything hangs in the balance. Most of the time, this will happen in a Dramatic scene, when special rules raise the stakes and you have greater control over the game (see page 335). However, this is only half the equation — even a Dramatic scene falls flat without a powerful dilemma and a compelling reason to tackle it. Emphasize the stakes with your very best dialog and descriptions. Drive the scene home with as much energy as you can muster. Stand. Few things get the players’ attention as quickly as the GM getting out of his chair.</p><h3>CHARACTER DEATH</h3><p>The line between challenging the PCs and overwhelming them is fine indeed and recognizing it before it’s crossed requires years of experience. It isn’t just a matter of rules and probability — it’s reading the players, anticipating their actions (especially the suicidal ones), and when needed, rescuing them from themselves.</p><p>When you’re planning a deadly adventure, try to give the players a bit of warning, if not directly then certainly through the tone and escalating situations facing them in the game. Ideally, no adventure will require the death of a player character but in the event that one does it’s even more vital the players see it coming. Prophesies are helpful for this, as are visions and other supernatural phenomena.</p><p>Of course, characters die accidentally: the party might underestimate a monster’s threat, or you might not realize how deadly it is when building it; a failed saving throw can pitch a character into a lake of boiling acid; or a mook can score a lucky shot in a Dramatic scene. In any of these cases, and particularly when a hero’s death would be anti-climactic or hurt the story, you can fall back on the rules for Cheating Death (see page 384).</p><p>No matter when or how death occurs, give the player a final bit of glory, a chance to go out in style — with a closing phrase, action, or just a moment of reverence. All PCs are heroes when they die; it’s the nature of things. The players will appreciate you making an effort to portray this at the table.</p><h3>INTRODUCING NEW CHARACTERS</h3><p>When a PC dies, it usually falls to you to introduce his replacement. This is a lot like bringing the party together for the first time (see page 329) and motivating the party in each adventure (see page 327). Linking the new character’s arrival to the previous character’s death is by far your strongest option — perhaps he’s a mutual enemy of the hero’s killer, or a close friend or relative interested in justice (or vengeance) — though you could just as easily bring him in as a mercenary hired to help with the next quest, or assigned by the party’s patron.</p><p>New characters can enter the campaign at the party’s average Career Level, or perhaps one level lower if you’d like them to “earn their stripes” (this can discourage players from “recycling” characters when they discover a better set of options, and also forces them to work a bit harder to establish themselves in a veteran party). When characters are introduced at a lower Career Level, be sure to let them earn a little bonus XP until they catch up (see page 342).</p><h2>KEEPING THINGS ON TRACK</h2><p>If there’s one universal rule for GMs, it’s this — none of your plans will survive contact with the players. They’ll invariably take adventures into uncharted territory, interpret your plots in ways you couldn’t imagine, and do things that defy your best efforts and planning. This isn’t malicious — it’s merely players assuming their natural role as “chaos” in the make-believe universe. Fortunately, you have some options for guiding the party back to the beaten path.</p><h3>NUDGE THE PARTY</h3><p>It’s usually best for a party to return to the plot on its own terms, without your direct intervention. Players understandably like to be captains of their own destinies and that’s part of what makes a tabletop RPG so much fun. Of course, affording them that latitude and still keeping them on target is can be tricky. The keys are subtlety and plausibility. Whenever possible, try to fold pointers back to the plot into the situation at hand.</p><p>For instance, when the party sails to a remote island to face a lich lord, you might not have the time or desire to map out miles of sea in every direction. Instead you can establish, early on or as the characters investigate the surrounding terrain, that the seas are infested with serpents and the neighboring islands are home to dangerous cannibals. Hopefully the players will think twice before diverting their charted course.</p><p>Take care not to overuse this option. If every scene involves the characters moving strictly from point A to point B, the PCs will start to feel powerless, not so much captains of destiny as stowaways in your story.</p><h3>FOLLOW THEIR LEAD</h3><p>Sometimes the players will suggest something that, despite falling outside the adventure, is too much fun to pass up. Indulge them! You’ve got all the tools you need at your fingertips: dozens of readymade monsters and rogues in Chapter 6, plenty of random treasure and other rewards for victory (see page 344), and Complications to keep things interesting (see page 366). All that’s needed is a little ingenuity and the time and willingness to go along for the ride.</p><p>Consider the previous example. Perhaps one of the players deduces that the lich lord hasn’t conquered the cannibal islands because they have some power over him. This isn’t something you’ve planned for but it sounds like an opportunity to enrich the adventure, so you run with it. After a brief course change (and a scuffle with a sea dragon run directly out of Chapter 6), the party encounters a tribe of cannibals and their necromancer king, learning that he keeps the lich lord at bay with a scepter topped with a golden monkey skull (a minor artifact you whip up on the fly using the rules at the back of Chapter 4). If the party can steal it, they’ll have a new edge against the adventure’s villain but even if they don’t the players will still see the value of their input. They’ll know they can command the story as decisively as you, which is more important than any planned scene or encounter.</p><h3>LET THEM WIN</h3><p>Statistically, 5% of all rolls fail (with a natural 1), which makes sense in isolated situations — especially dire, desperate ones. It breaks down a bit in relatively harmless situations, however, when the characters should be largely immune to misfortune. Fortunately, there’s a simple answer: don’t make them roll unless failure will mean something. For example, if the characters have lots of time and can simply retry a skill check, there’s no reason to roll (they’ll just try again, probably without penalty).</p><p>The watchwords here are “risk” and “consequence” — rolling without either is a pointless waste of time. What constitutes “risk” and “consequence” is entirely up to you. A character might not have to Impress a current lover to receive help, but a spurned former lover is another thing altogether (there’s a risk of being turned away). If that lover’s also sleeping with the sheriff, there’s consequence too.</p><p>Keep your eyes peeled for “dice fatigue.” Excessive die rolling can bog the game down, particularly when most of the characters are highly skilled and most of the checks are unopposed (a recipe for constant success, and lots of meaningless rolls). In these cases, you might want to let any character whose total bonus exceeds a DC succeed without rolling. As an example, let’s say the party is scrambling across a narrow beam over a pit (Acrobatics DC 15). If the characters’ Acrobatics bonuses are +18, +15, and +5, you might only make the third character roll as he’s the only one with a reasonable chance to fail. Table 7.21: Chance of Success is your best friend when making these kinds of calls on the fly (see page 370).</p><h3>FAILURE IS AN OPTION</h3><p>In any world where risk is constant, failure isn’t far behind. Characters sometimes lose but it’s important to remember that players don’t. Every player, including you, wins just for showing up and having a good time. Some players take failure personally — whether it’s losing a fight, letting a valuable piece of treasure slip through their fingers, or falling short of an objective — but you can turn it around for them. As in the earlier burglar example (see page 359), the trick is turning the failure into new chances for adventure.</p><p>Let’s say, for example, that the party fails to stop a doppelganger from kidnapping and replacing an influential lord in the king’s court. This is a sad outcome and may have lasting impacts on the larger setting, but there’s no reason for the adventure to end there. What if, in the process of hunting the creature, the party also discovered a far-reaching conspiracy against the throne? Suddenly the opportunities for redemption abound! There’s less time for the players to grouse about their setback when they’re mounting a resistance against the new regime.</p><h3>SO IS LYING</h3><p>When running a game, the adventure is your Bible and the rules are your Commandments, yet one of the most effective ways to keep things on track is to ignore them. Don’t hesitate to seize opportunities to improve the game, even if they contradict the story you’ve laid out or the DCs and stats you’ve built. Have the players suggested a way out of a trap that’s more interesting than what you’ve built into the adventure? Let them escape and applaud their ingenuity. Will a roll that’s just a bit too low derail the adventure? Lower the DC and describe the narrow victory.</p><p>This is harder when you make everything known to the players, of course, which is why a little mystery can make all the difference. Limiting descriptions to just what the characters immediately sense is a good start. Some GMs also play with a screen to hide their rolls (so they can cheat for both sides), and others make critical rolls behind cupped hands.</p><h2>HANDLING ACTION</h2><p>Daring sword fights, nail-biting chases, and explosive magic duels are hallmarks of high adventure fantasy, regardless of world or adventure, so it’s extremely helpful to develop a style for running action sequences. Ask yourself how important action is to the game you’re running: How often does it appear, and how intense does it get? What flavor of action do you enjoy most: Flashy or restrained? Outlandish or grounded? Chaotic or tactical? Escalating or decisive? Should your action style change from adventure to adventure? Most importantly, how would the players answer these questions?</p><p>Action is often easiest to define with references to movies, comics, or video games you’d like to emulate. This can quickly translate what often amounts to a feeling, putting the whole group on the same page and providing them with handy cues to fall back on during the game. Common references can also quickly illustrate any differences between your tastes, and might suggest ways to blend them together as something new.</p><h3>ACTION ADVENTURE PHYSICS</h3><p>One of the first things to decide is the point at which action goes too far. If your world is “low fantasy” or very grounded, then “realistic” physics and human capabilities are the goal and a lot of movie action is right out. Over-the-top gonzo action is much easier, as there really aren’t any true limits. In-between are most established fantasy worlds, like Middle Earth, Narnia, Westros (The Song of Ice and Fire), and the Domination (The Black Company).</p><p>Unmodified, Fantasy Craft is somewhere in the middle, its action similar to that seen in most high fantasy film and roleplaying. The heroes regularly push themselves beyond the limits of normal men, stand toe-to-toe with brutal monsters, weather savage magic, and survive against all realistic odds. Real world physics apply, though magic and other forces can break them, and many rules bend them to keep the action fast and fun (the hero on page 6 is a great example — there’s really no way he could topple an idol that large on his own, but it’s fun so it’s allowed).</p><p>There are lots of ways to adjust this baseline. Campaign qualities are one of the most direct (see page 322), and you could also disallow or adjust certain skill DCs and feats, though much of what defines action adventure physics in your world won’t necessarily be supported (directly) by rules. Rather, they lie in what’s impossible. With a high enough Acrobatics rank, can a character perform a standing back flip? How far can a character fall before he’s well and truly dead? Can the party really survive being catapulted 300 ft. over a wall of fire, landing in a somersault over burning coals without injury? Any or all of these options are fine, so long as everyone knows what to expect.</p><h3>ACTION CUES</h3><p>Players sometimes find the uncertainty of adventure maddening, especially when it comes to drawing their weapons. They know brandishing steel too early can derail the narrative but doing so too late can cost them valuable tactical advantages. Establishing a few non-verbal cues that it’s time for violence can smooth this shift and generally improve the flow of play. You can speed up or alter the tone of your voice, roll a special initiative die, or (if you’re not using the tactic to keep energy high), just stand up. All that’s important is keeping the cue(s) consistent.</p><h3>DESCRIBING ACTION</h3><p>A frequently overlooked way to generate excitement is “choreographing” attacks, describing with more flair than “you hit” or “you inflict 12 points of damage.” It helps to have a strong mental picture of the “set;” keep track of the characters’ locations at all times and their surroundings will suggest quite a few ways to spice up your action descriptions. For example, in a bar fight a critical miss with a bow might send the arrow over the target’s shoulder, tipping over a cask of highly flammable alcohol. Later, a hit with a Bull Rush in the same area might send another target careening across the spill, which might lead to him going up like a Roman candle if he’s later attacked with fire (or caught in the blast of a fireball).</p><p>Other useful details when describing action are the difference between the attack result and the target’s Defense (or the difference between a save result and the DC), and amount of damage suffered. These are hard numerical gauges of severity you can use to fuel narrative outcomes. Despite the fact that a hit with a result of 16 against a Defense of 14 likely has the same mechanical effect as a hit with a result of 22 against a Defense of 12, the two should feel entirely different. For instance, you might describe the first as “a glancing blow that draws a thin line of blood across the enemy’s arm,” and the second as “burying the blade deep in his chest, leaving him gasping for air.” Narrative details not only give everyone a better picture of the action but draw them further into it, and may also make up for a lackluster roll.</p><h3>IMPROVISING DAMAGE</h3><p>In the heat of a fight, an enthusiastic hero might grab a mundane object to use as a weapon (like a large rock or severed body part), or he might come up with an unusual variation on a weapon (e.g. coating his spear in oil and setting it alight). Though the damage of each weapon is set, you can always change or add to it. One-handed improvised weapons tend to inflict 1d6 damage, two-handed ones 1d8, and really large ones 1d10. You can also swap out damage types — in the case of the flaming spear, for example, from lethal to fire — but make sure each weapon inflicts only one damage type.</p><p>Another way to adjust damage is with stress (see page 211). If you feel the target is measurably unnerved by an attack, inflict stress damage as described (equal to half or all the damage inflicted). Going back to the flaming spear example, a light-sensitive goblin might suffer half stress damage while a creature with the Achilles heel (fire) quality might suffer an equal amount.</p><h3>TRACKING INITIATIVE</h3><p>Fantasy fights can get pretty involved, especially with many combatants. Grouping Initiative for each side can speed things up (see page 203), though this works best for mobs and other standard NPCs (special characters should get the chance to set up their own tactics in their own time). Adopting a system for tracking initiative is also a great help, preventing the action from stalling as you work out the next fighter. The simplest option is to jot down the names and Counts of each character, then scan the list after each action, though you could also put some of the onus on the players. Assign one of them “initiative keeper” so you can stay focused on resolving and describing action, or hand out numbered cards to each player — in the order they’re set to act — and have them flip them over as they complete their turns.</p><h2>BALANCING ENCOUNTERS</h2><p>In combat, it’s easy to think of yourself as the party’s enemy (they often think so), but remember that you’re there in part to make sure they have a good time. They want a challenge — but they also want to win, and even more importantly, they don’t want their teeth kicked in. Injury and death are universal constants in a violent RPG world and the players know that, but they also invest a lot of time and energy into their characters and don’t like starting over. Don’t make them without a good reason (and a fitting send-off).</p><p>There are lots of lessons here: Don’t circumvent or shut down the party’s only way to beat an enemy. Don’t ruthlessly pummel the party. Look for reasons not to kill characters. Spread the enemies and their attacks around. Remember that every combat has a “temperature.” You want to raise the heat by degrees, but not to a boil. When the players are hurting, feel free to turn up the flame, but when they’re dying, find reasons not to. Introduce reinforcements to distract the enemy, or flare tensions in the enemy’s ranks, having them fight each other for a round or two. Intelligent enemies might prefer to take prisoners, or taunt their opponents. Unexpected events like cave-ins and stampeding wildlife can separate combatants, and are especially fitting when they’re supported by previous events in the story or the combat. Never hesitate to expand a combat’s narrative to save the party’s bacon.</p><p>NPCs have many special advantages that make them interesting for you to run and exciting for the players to fight. A monster with three or more natural attacks can flurry to attack once with each of them. Qualities like charge attack and frenzy add even more offensive capability, while rend and swift attack grant free attacks that can even be used on the move. Extraordinary attacks are particularly powerful but may only be used once per round (except during a frenzy), and most still require an attack check. The options are balanced in a vacuum but given the open-ended nature of NPC design it’s easy to go overboard, making adversaries unstoppably powerful. Take special care not to overbuild NPCs and even if you do, remember that you don’t have to throw everything an adversary has at the party, especially not every round.</p><p>Finally, keep the enemy’s psychology in mind. The Bestiary describes how creatures tend to behave in combat, but you can and should adjust by circumstance and to taste. Not only can this justify non-lethal actions, it can make fights unique. Going toeto- toe with a territorial pack hunter should be a very different experience than exchanging precision blows with an honorable swordsman. A combat could even change mid-way through (say, when the sorcerer magically dominating a troll is slain, shifting the behemoth from a sluggish weapon of brute force into a raging force of nature, looking to take its anger out on anything that moves).</p><p>Predators and small humanoids often rely on ambushes and concentrate their attacks on weak and slow targets. Scavengers and parasites attack by opportunity, fleeing when they face resistance or eat their fill. Peaceful and herd creatures fight only if cornered and to drive away threats to their young (and rarely pursue those who flee). Nearly every creature has a breaking point, which you can decide arbitrarily before the combat (e.g. a special adversary losing half its vitality or a standard adversary suffering 15 or more damage), or you can apply Morale (see page 379).</p><h3>CHANGING THE RULES</h3><p>One of your greatest powers is the authority to tailor the rules for your game and group, but it’s important to do so with your eyes wide open. Every Fantasy Craft rule was designed for a specific purpose and it’s not always obvious how changing a rule might impact the rest of the system. Before you make changes of your own, take a look through campaign qualities (see page 322), which are all built to plug fluidly into the greater game. If you’re still not happy with a rule, ask yourself some questions: Why am I changing the rule? Am I clear about how it really works? Why do I think the rule exists? Do I know what other rules might change if I adjust this one? Will changing the rule imbalance the game or give certain character types, classes, or species an unfair advantage or deficit? Will the change make more players happy than not?</p><p>Ask the players for input. Discuss rules changes before implementing them. Players tend to engage with the rules very differently than GMs, and their perspective can be invaluable. When you’re comfortable with a change, test it out for a few sessions and see how it fares. Don’t be afraid to take it back if it doesn’t work out but when you find a house rule you really like, visit the Crafty Games forums and share!</p><h3>IGNORING THE RULES</h3><p>Easier than changing the rules is ignoring them. Again, it’s important to consider the ramifications. Take, for example, the movement rule that you must stop whenever adjacent to an opponent. This may seem like a small and inconsequential mechanic, but ignoring it also disables one of the most useful Acrobatics checks (Tumble), and more importantly reduces a party’s ability to shield its weaker combatants with tougher ones.</p><h2>AVOIDING BURNOUT</h2><p>Eventually, your campaign may start to wind down, or you may eventually get tired of running and want to play the game instead. Consider stepping aside and letting someone new take over your duties. There are a number of possible solutions.</p><h3>INTERLUDES</h3><p>Sometimes a brief respite is all the break you need. Let one of the other players take over as GM for just one or two adventures — maybe in the same continuity, maybe with all-new characters. If you’d like to preserve your story and still enjoy an interlude, carve out a separate region for the new GM and let him do what he likes, so long as he doesn’t impact anything you’ve already introduced (you can give him a short list of other things to avoid as well, unless you’re worried they’ll spoil upcoming play).</p><p>Interludes are excellent chances to try out different styles of play, perhaps with different campaign qualities and trial rules. They’re also great for following up with interesting plots previously left by the wayside (such as rescuing a village that was taken over by an oppressive warlord, or following up on leads about treasure in a distant jungle). Regardless of the details, interludes should always be self-contained — unless, of course, they turn into troupe play.</p><h3>TROUPE PLAY</h3><p>Some groups, particularly those with multiple experienced GMs in their ranks, may consider a round-robin approach in which two or more GMs trade off, running adventures in the same or splinter storylines. This is a great approach for groups with irregular attendance but can produce uneven results without careful management. At the very least, all troupe GMs should agree on basic boundaries and rules to avoid contradicting each other or damaging the campaign’s continuity.</p><h3>PASSING THE TORCH</h3><p>When and if it’s time for you to retire as the group’s GM, the group needs to consider whether your successor will follow your setting and storyline or start something new. While everyone’s involved, the greatest voice must be yours, as you’ll be the one deciding whether to resolve any outstanding plotlines (if you haven’t already).</p><p>If the new GM takes over in the same world, be sure to pass along any notes or materials he may need, and wash your hands of it. Separation anxiety is very real but it’s vital that you support and respect the new GM’s work if the game is to keep going strong.</p><h3>SHARING THE WORK</h3><p>When you’re starting to feel overwhelmed by the work of running, consider assigning some of it to the players. Think of yourself like a U.S. President with the players as your cabinet — you can have a Secretary of Defense (who manages initiative), an Attorney General (who stays abreast of mechanical disputes and advises you before rules calls), a Secretary of the Interior (who sets up the play area before games), and even a Secretary of Agriculture (who gets munchies)! Just a few duties off your plate can make your job worlds easier, and get everyone more involved to boot!</p><h3>EMBRACING YOUR LIMITATIONS</h3><p>Yours is a big job and you’re just one person. Be careful not to bite off more than you can chew when you start, and increase the scope of your game slowly over time. Watch for things you do well and things you don’t, and look for ways to redistribute the latter. The players are there to have a good time and they won’t mind helping out. Focus your game on the things you and the players do best and you’ll all have a much better time.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1300000,"name":"GM ACTION DICE","type":"text","_id":"FmqxMXmvmDaa4WV1","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Action dice can be one of your greatest tools to keep the heroes on their toes and your game on track. Like PCs, you can boost rolls, activate threats and errors, and heal NPCs, but you can also introduce campaign qualities and Dramatic scenes, rescue and promote NPCs, and more! All this power comes with a great responsibility, of course: You shouldn’t look at your dice as a way to make the characters’ lives difficult but rather as a way to make sure the players have fun. Never use your dice to pick on a player, or to spoil a player’s moment of glory — it ruins everyone’s fun. Instead, use your dice to raise the stakes and encourage the characters to step up, improving the game for everyone.</p><p>You receive a number of action dice at the start of each game session equal to the number of player characters present + twice the adventure’s Menace.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Five PCs are present for a Menace IV adventure. You begin the session with 13 action dice.</p><p>You gain more action dice for awarding PC action dice (see right) and offering hints (see page 366). All action dice not spent at the end of each session are lost.</p><p>Your action dice may be spent in the following ways. When one of these options asks you to roll a die on behalf of an NPC, roll 1d6 (if the NPC is standard) or 1 die type higher than the highest action die rolled by the PCs (if the NPC is special).</p><p><em>Example:</em> The most experienced PC at the table is Level 11. He has no feats or other options that improve his action die type, so he rolls d8s. When rolling on behalf of a special NPC, you roll d10s.</p><h4>1. BOOST AN NPC DIE ROLL</h4><p>You may spend 1 action die to boost an NPC die roll as if he were a player character (see page 62).</p><h4>2. BOOST AN NPC’S DEFENSE</h4><p>You may spend 1 action die to boost an NPC’s Defense as if he were a player character (see page 63).</p><h4>3. ACTIVATE AN NPC’S THREAT</h4><p>When a special NPC or a character with the treacherous quality scores a threat, you may spend 1 or more action dice to activate the threat (see page 235).</p><h4>4. ACTIVATE A PC OR NPC’S ERROR</h4><p>When an opponent within an NPC’s line of sight suffers an error with an attack or skill check, you may spend 1 or more action dice to activate it as a critical miss or failure (see page 208 and 65, respectively).</p><h4>5. HEAL AN NPC</h4><p>You may spend any number of action dice to heal an NPC (see page 212).</p><h4>6. PROMOTE A STANDARD NPC</h4><p>You may spend 2 action dice at any time to promote a standard character to special character for the duration of the current adventure (see page 337).</p><h4>7. HAVE A VILLAIN CHEAT DEATH</h4><p>You may spend 4 action dice to let a villain Cheat Death (see page 384). The players don’t vote or otherwise influence the story of his escape; instead, you develop the reasons — potentially when building a later adventure — and reveal them as a natural part of the story. The villain does suffer a random Impact, however: roll 1d4+1 (or a higher die type, if you want a less controlled result), and consult Table 7.28: Cheating Death (see page 386).</p><p>XP is awarded as if the villain was defeated. He may not return in this adventure.</p><h4>8. ADD A TEMPORARY CAMPAIGN QUALITY</h4><p>You may spend action dice at any time to add a campaign quality for the rest of the scene. You may only add a campaign quality with an action die cost (see page 322).</p><h4>9. PROMPT A DRAMATIC SCENE</h4><p>You may spend 4 action dice to upgrade the current scene to Dramatic (see page 335).</p><h2>AWARDING PC ACTION DICE</h2><p>Action dice are a valuable commodity at the game table, giving everyone the power to tweak the odds and change the rules when needed to keep the game fun and challenging. Everyone starts with a small pool of them but it’s your job to keep them flowing. Any time you’re impressed with a player or PC’s behavior or performance at the table, you can award the player a bonus action die and gain one for yourself.</p><p>You can award action dice for many things and you’ll quickly develop your own criteria but as a general rule you can hand one out…</p><p>• Anytime a player attempts something heroic or selfless, whether he’s successful or not</p><p>• Anytime a player roleplays well or makes decisions supporting his character concept</p><p>• Anytime a player acts in service of his Alignment</p><p>• Anytime a player exhibits strong leadership or problem-solving ability</p><p>• Anytime a player helps to move the story along</p><p>• Anytime a player promotes fun and enjoyment at the table</p><p>It’s especially important to reward acts that meet these criteria despite any game penalties they might inflict, as it reinforces daring actions and keeps the players taking chances. Likewise, you should spend your action dice to support those chances, and do everything in your power to ensure PCs don’t needlessly suffer for their effort — because without that effort, they’d never win.</p><p>On average you should hand out at least 1 action die every 20–30 minutes. Action dice are the grease that keeps the Fantasy Craft game engine running, and a healthy stream of them not only makes the players comfortable spending the ones they’ve got but keeps your stack high as well. Try to spread rewards between all the players — if someone’s shy, nervous, or just not having a great day it’s all that much more important to highlight his noteworthy moments.</p><h2>HINTS</h2><p>Sometimes the players get stuck. They find themselves stumped by a puzzle, at a loss in an investigation, unsure how to beat a foe, or just asking “What are we missing?” At times like this you can offer them a hint.</p><p>Unlike clues, hints don’t necessarily point the way to upcoming scenes but rather focus on what’s happening to the party right now. They might give the party additional insight about enemies, describe things from a different perspective, remind players about something they’ve forgotten, point to clues they’ve missed, or just give them something new to think about. Hints can be as pointed or vague as the situation demands but they should always be immediately useful. The best hints get the players halfway there and let them figure it out from there.</p><p>Hints are best presented when you have a firm grasp of your party’s problem solving abilities, so you’ll get better at offering them over time. At first it’s best to err on the side of caution, giving more information rather than less. The worst you can do is push the game along a little faster than expected.</p><p>For each hint you offer, you gain 1 action die. Some players may have abilities that prompt you to give hints, in which case they usually gain an action die if you refuse; otherwise, PCs neither gain nor lose action dice for hints.</p><h2>NARRATIVE CONTROL</h2><p>Action dice not only change the odds, they can change the world! Using these optional rules, anyone can spend one to four action dice to subtly shift details in their favor. The more action dice spent, the bigger the shift. In many ways this is like activating critical hits/successes and misses/failures (see pages 207 and 65). It’s a way to mildly nudge the story to help or hinder the party, or make life interesting for everyone.</p><p>Shifts enacted by players are called Perks. When a Perk directly affects more than one character, those involved may pool action dice to request it (e.g. two characters spending 2 dice each for a four-die Perk, one character spending 2 dice and two others spending 1 each, etc.). Perks can help get players out of a bind but they shouldn’t eliminate challenge or undermine encounters. Here are some examples.</p><p><strong>1 Action Die:</strong> Fortuitous terrain (stairs or a table offering “higher ground,” a chandelier allowing a character to swing around an enemy, etc.) offers a +1 bonus with 1 character’s attacks for 1 round; nearby cover (1/4); a guard straying a bit from his post (–2 with Notice and Search checks); a hero fallen into a pit discovers rough handholds on the pit wall (Climb DC 25 to escape); favorable travel conditions (convenient bridges, a friendly caravan, etc.) let the party move 1 MPH faster for 1 Downtime period; room available at a booked or busy inn (common lodging)</p><p><strong>2 Action Dice:</strong> Fortuitous terrain offers +1 bonus to 2 characters for 1 round; nearby cover (1/2); a guard preoccupied with other tasks (–4 with Notice and Search checks); a hero fallen into a pit discovers a vine dangling within reach (Climb DC 20 to escape); auspicious travel conditions let the party move 2 MPH faster for 1 Downtime period; room available at a booked or busy inn (up to fancy lodging)</p><p><strong>3 Action Dice:</strong> Fortuitous terrain offers +1 bonus to 3 characters for 1 round; nearby cover (3/4); a guard who’s fast asleep; a hero fallen into a pit discovers a rusty but working pulley that lasts long enough to get him out (Climb DC 15 to escape); remarkable travel conditions let the party move 3 MPH faster for 1 Downtime period; room available at a booked or busy inn (up to luxurious lodging)</p><p><strong>4 Action Dice:</strong> Fortuitous terrain offers +1 bonus to whole party for 1 round; nearby cover (total); an alarm summons all but essential guards to another location; a hero fallen into a pit discovers a secret tunnel leading out (and perhaps leading to greater adventure!); miraculous travel conditions let the party move 4 MPH faster for 1 Downtime period; room available at a booked or busy inn (up to extravagant lodging)</p><p>Shifts you enact are called Complications. Manipulating fluid details is part of your normal job, of course, but Complications provide a fair framework for various common mechanical events and obstacles. Whenever possible you should apply action die costs to shifts you apply on the fly (above and beyond any prepared adventure). It helps to promote the action die economy, illustrates your commitment to fair play, and gives the players an exciting peek “behind the screen.” Here are some examples.</p><p><strong>1 Action Die:</strong> Collapsed pillar, tree, or other large debris fills 1 square; surface changes across area (giant boiling pot tipped over, loose debris scattered everywhere, magic ice covers area, etc.), reducing Speed by 5 ft.; cover damaged or destroyed (drops by 1/4); item malfunctions (1 half action to fix); up to Tiny scenery destroyed by collateral damage (falling pillar or boulder, ballista shot, etc.); a dropped item disappears under furniture or into a tight crevice (1 extra half action to retrieve); troublesome travel conditions (brigands handled off screen, a nosy portmaster, etc.) slow the party by 1 MPH for 1 Downtime period (minimum 0); the only room at an inn is poor lodging</p><p><strong>2 Action Dice:</strong> Large debris fills 2 squares; surface changes across area, reducing Speed by 10 ft.; cover damaged or destroyed (drops by 1/2); item malfunctions (1 full action and Crafting DC 10 to fix); Medium scenery destroyed; a dropped item disappears through a grate or under a locked door; ill-fated travel conditions slow the party by 2 MPH for 1 Downtime period (minimum 0); no rooms at the inn</p><p><strong>3 Action Dice:</strong> Large debris fills 3 squares; surface changes across area, reducing Speed by 15 ft.; cover damaged or destroyed (drops by 3/4); item malfunctions (1 full action and Crafting DC 15 to fix); Huge scenery destroyed; a dropped item lands at an enemy’s feet; wretched travel conditions slow the party by 3 MPH for 1 Downtime period (minimum 0); someone at the inn remembers the characters… bitterly</p><p><strong>4 Action Dice:</strong> Large debris fills 4 squares; surface changes across area, reducing Speed by 20 ft.; cover destroyed (entirely); item malfunctions (1 full action and Crafting DC 20 to fix); Colossal scenery destroyed; a dropped item is lost or destroyed (e.g. is swallowed by a passing wyvern, falls into a vat of acid, etc.); disastrous travel conditions slow the party by 4 MPH for 1 Downtime period (minimum 0); the party resembles a group on a poster at the inn (a wanted poster)</p><p>You determine the cost of Narrative Control based on the desired impact. As shown in the previous examples, minor, extremely likely changes cost only 1 die while larger, less plausible changes cost up to 4.</p><p>Narrative Control is not absolute control — certain rules and limitations apply.</p><p>• When Narrative Control is allowed, it’s available to everyone (you and all players).</p><p>• No one may change established reality. If something’s already happened or been proven, it’s permanent.</p><p>• You must approve every Perk and Complication before it enters play.</p><p>• Action dice may not be spent to counter or cancel Narrative Control, no matter who enacts it. Once a Perk or Complication is approved, it becomes a permanent change to the world. If you and the party both spend action dice on the same thing (e.g. on travel conditions), your dice are applied and the party regains their dice.</p><p>Narrative Control is an excellent way to handle divine assistance. It lets everyone introduce potentially miraculous events with as much (or as little) heavenly flavor as you like. Other Complications appear throughout Fantasy Craft, including critical miss effects (see page 208) and travel encounters (see page 372).</p><p>Perks and Complications are best introduced when conditions suggest them. A Stolen Item Complication is best introduced when the party visits a seedy part of town, and a Sympathetic Adversary Perk is most likely when the enemy’s leader is hateful and draconian. Among other factors, plausibility should guide whether you allow a Perk or introduce a Complication.</p><p>The following are just a few of the many things you can do with Narrative Control. Tweak them to taste and work with the players to develop more.</p><h3>PLAYER PERKS</h3><p>Unless otherwise specified, the party may only use each of these scripted Perks once per adventure. Perks you (the GM) decline don’t count toward this limit, and non-scripted Perks may show up as often as you allow.</p><h4>FLASH-FORWARD</h4><p>Sometimes an encounter isn’t working. No one’s into it or the solution to the problem is eluding everyone. In these cases the party can spend 4 action dice to suggest the action “flash forward” to the next encounter (past the current fight or death trap, out of an ugly social situation that no one’s excited about, etc.). If you agree, you may concoct whatever story or circumstances you like to explain the intervening time — indeed, the party is giving you this right by enacting this Perk — though you may ask for ideas if you’re at a loss and/or would like to include the players in the narrative. All rewards from the encounter are forfeit, including XP and treasure.</p><h4>I HAVE ONE OF THOSE!</h4><p>The party may spend one or more action dice to “remember” they brought a non-magical item with them (retroactively adding the item to their inventory), to find one in the area, or to find something that makes a good improvised version (see page 73). Improvised versions have a few drawbacks but may be the only option when there’s little or no chance of finding the real item in the area. The item’s Complexity may not exceed 5 per action die spent (maximum 20).</p><h4>NEVER TELL US THE ODDS</h4><p>As Initiative is rolled, the party may opt to worsen the odds, spending 2 or 4 action dice. If you agree, the number of adversaries increases by 1 special NPC or 1 mob of standard NPCs per 2 action dice spent. This is a Perk because the party benefits from extra XP and potentially better treasure as a result (see pages 342 and 344).</p><h4>SYMPATHETIC ADVERSARY</h4><p>The party may spend one or more action dice to sway a standard adversary to their side for the rest of the scene. The NPC’s XP value may not exceed 20 per action die spent (maximum 80). The NPC is Neutral with the party and won’t risk his life. Unless detained, he leaves at the end of the scene, though he could potentially make subsequent appearances if it supports the story.</p><h4>UNEXPECTED HELP</h4><p>The party may spend one or more action dice to introduce a single NPC from the Rogues Gallery (see page 244), who helps them for the rest of the scene. This Perk otherwise operates like Sympathetic Adversary, except that the NPC is Friendly with the party.</p><h3>GM COMPLICATIONS</h3><p>As illustrated here, Complications don’t include tools you need to manage scenes and move the story along (such as guards, suspicious NPCs, endangered bystanders, and surprise combats). Instead, they present various impediments and difficulties that may befall the party, some of which might leave a bad taste in the players’ mouths without a concrete cost. The GM can (and periodically should) enact Perks as well, especially when the party is having a hard time.</p><h4>ADVENTURERS IN TOWN!</h4><p>You may spend up to four action dice to have local merchants realize adventurers have arrived and raise their prices (by 25% per action die spent).</p><h4>LOST OR STOLEN ITEM</h4><p>You can spend up to three action dice to have the party misplace an item (Search DC 10 + 5 per die spent to find it). Alternately, you can spend four action dice to have an item go missing (dropped, left behind, or stolen).

As the characters gain levels and their skill ranks improve, these results become easier and new results become available. By the highest levels your characters can master several skills and become extremely capable with most if not all of the rest (some classes offer more skill points and better skill bonuses and benefits than others, so results will vary).</p><p>Using this system of static DCs, a higher level character specializing in a skill should best a lower level one specializing in the same skill the vast majority of the time, especially as the level gap widens. Static DCs are excellent when you want the characters’ to become experts over time, growing from highly competent heroes at Level 1 to world-class badasses at Level 20.</p><p>An optional alternative, sliding DCs, uses a simple formula to calculate each DC, incorporating Threat Level (see page 335). This keeps the difficulty of each skill attempt at roughly the same as the characters rise in level, making the play experience roughly the same throughout. New levels grant more options but not necessarily more power. Sliding DCs are superior when you want to set the scope of your game at Level 1 (the characters becoming acknowledged champions in their fields, for example) and have that remain the case mechanically until Level 20.</p><p>Note that attack ability naturally follows a sliding scale, as do opposed skill checks, as the “DCs” of both (Defense in the case of attacks) commonly rise with the opponent’s level. This choice of static vs. sliding DCs only matters with unopposed skill checks.</p><h4>Table 7.21: Chance of Success</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">DC Minus Skill Bonus</th><th>Chance of Success</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1 or less</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">2</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">4</td><td>85%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">5</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">6</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">7</td><td>70%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">8</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">9</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">10</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">11</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">12</td><td>45%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">13</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">14</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">15</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">16</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">17</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">18</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">19</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">20</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">21 or more</td><td>Impossible</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>USING STATIC DCS</h2><p>The DCs in Chapter 2 should cover most needs. When the characters want to do something unopposed that isn’t covered there, simply apply a DC of 10 (easy), 15 (average), 20 (tricky), 25 (hard), or 30 (desperate). Recognize that even a Level 1 character can quickly render easy results trivial if they specialize (with a +2 attribute bonus and maximum skill ranks, a Level 1 character can beat a DC of 10 with a roll of 4), and that this discrepancy grows as the characters gain levels.</p><p>For a specific percentage chance of success, subtract the character’s total skill bonus from the DC and consult Table 7.21: Chance of Success (see below). Be careful not to assign impossible DCs unless you want to eliminate that particular option for the character.</p><h2>USING SLIDING DCs</h2><p>Sliding DCs are assigned using the same rough difficulty scale — easy, average, tricky, hard, and desperate — but the actual numbers are based on an individual character’s Career Level (if he’s working alone) or the party’s Threat Level (when they’re working together). With these details in hand, simply consult Table 7.22: Sliding DCs (see below).</p><p>You can also use this table to convert static DCs found in Chapter 2. Round the static DC to the nearest multiple of 5 and use the column that most closely matches: easy for 10, average for 15, tricky for 20, hard for 25, and desperate for 30 and above.</p><p>This table assumes progressively higher rolls and attribute bonuses with each degree of difficulty, but keeps the skill rank investment fairly level, and subdued, throughout the character’s career. Thus a character who specializes has an edge, even against a sliding DC.</p><h4>Table 7.22: Sliding DCs</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Career/Threat Level</th><th>Easy</th><th>Average</th><th>Tricky</th><th>Hard</th><th>Desperate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">1–2</td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>16</td><td>19</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">3–4</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">5–6</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>21</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">7–8</td><td>13</td><td>16</td><td>19</td><td>22</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">9–10</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>23</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">11–12</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">13–14</td><td>16</td><td>19</td><td>22</td><td>25</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">15–16</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>23</td><td>26</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">17–18</td><td>18</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>27</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">19–20</td><td>20</td><td>23</td><td>26</td><td>29</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1500000,"name":"MANAGING DOWNTIME","type":"text","_id":"iBITBV4c2aPs293P","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Downtime is a powerful time management tool, giving you the opportunity to “gloss over” parts of the game that offer little or no challenge or roleplay potential. It also lets the players pursue interesting but lengthy projects like building and repairing things, conducting research, and treating complex illnesses without interrupting the game for everyone else.</p><p>Most Downtime activities should resolve cleanly per the rules and any choices you need to make — such as the focus to apply during a Build or Repair check — should be obvious. Your chief concern is when to start and stop each Downtime period. Frequently, opportunities will present themselves in play — as the characters embark on a long journey, as they settle into town for a couple weeks’ relaxation, as they begin Downtime skill checks, etc. — but you can also plan for them as part of adventures. This is especially helpful when filling gaps in your story.</p><p>Downtime can happen as often or as rarely as you like, though you should avoid using it as a crutch to prop up underdeveloped adventures or to quash party initiative. Likewise, you should make sure the players don’t come to rely on it as a way to circumvent tough or undesirable encounters. Generally, Downtime is best used to fill “empty” game time and quickly resolve long and dull skill checks (many of which are already flagged in Chapter 2).</p><p>The length of a Downtime period is also up to you, though it should never be less than a full day, and shouldn’t extend beyond the first character returning to regular play (while Downtime is going on, all characters should be involved). It’s much easier to run one long Downtime period than many short ones, and constantly alternating between Downtime and standard play can get tedious, so it’s a good idea to “group” brief Downtime periods whenever possible, shifting standard encounters to happen before or after.</p><p>You can also be a bit duplicitous with Downtime, initially declaring a longer period and cutting it short. This is helpful when you need to conceal an upcoming (unexpected) event or plot twist, but it can go awry if used too often. No more than once every two or three adventures and you’re probably fine.</p><h2>TRAVEL</h2><p>One of the most common Downtime activities is travel. Vehicles have set Travel Speeds (see page 171), while mounts and characters have Travel Speeds in miles per hour equal to 1/10 their Speed (rounded up).</p><p><em>Example:</em> A hippocampus has a Swim Speed of 60 ft. Its Travel Speed is 6 MPH.</p><p>Travel Speeds are modified by terrain and weather, as shown on Table 7.23: Travel Speed by Terrain (see below). Once per Downtime period of travel, you may optionally make a team Survival check in secret against the DC listed on Table 7.23.</p><p>With failure, the party becomes lost, wasting a number of hours equal to the difference. Their side trek should only be detailed if you have something interesting prepared or want to apply a travel encounter.</p><h4>Table 7.23: Travel Speed by Terrain</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Conditions</th><th>Travel Speed</th><th>Survival Check DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Terrain</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Aquatic</td><td>—</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Arctic</td><td>—</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Caverns/mountains</td><td>–1</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Desert</td><td>—</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Forest/jungle</td><td>–1</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Indoors/settled</td><td>—</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Plains</td><td>—</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Swamp</td><td>–1</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Weather</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Dust/fog/rain/snow (1 die)</td><td>—</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Dust/fog/rain/snow (2 dice)</td><td>—</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Dust/fog/rain/snow (3 dice)</td><td>—</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Dust/fog/rain/snow (4 dice)</td><td>—</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Wind (1 die)</td><td>–1 / +1 *</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Wind (2 dice)</td><td>–2 / +2 *</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Wind (3 dice)</td><td>–3 / +3 *</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Wind (4 dice)</td><td>–4 / +4 *</td><td>—</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* In the air and at sea, the modifier to the left of the slash applies when moving against the wind while the modifier to the right applies when moving with it. On the ground these modifiers decrease to 1/2 (rounded down).</p><h2>TRAVEL ENCOUNTERS</h2><p>Travel may also be interrupted by planned encounters built into the adventure or impromptu encounters introduced as Complications (see page 366). This lets you decide on a case-by-case basis whether you want to spring something on a traveling party, rather than making it a matter of a random roll. If you’d prefer genuinely random encounters, see page 373.</p><p>Once per Downtime period of travel, you may spend one or more action dice to interrupt the journey with an encounter. You can choose the adversaries involved or randomly roll them on Table 7.24: Travel Encounters (see page 374). Paying the base action die cost introduces 1 special adversary or 1 mob of standard adversaries, and you may increase the number encountered by spending additional dice. You can also create mixed encounter groups in the same fashion. You can set the conditions of the encounter or roll them on Table 7.25: Encounter Conditions (see page 377).</p><p>Though many encounters can be presented as surprise attacks, it’s a good idea to periodically work one into the ongoing story. Characters hunting a villain, for example, might gut a defeated scavenger worm, finding the remains of the villain’s manservant in its belly. Perhaps the manservant was carrying an item important to the villain, in which case they might be able to use it to lure him out of hiding. These kinds of links make seemingly “random” encounters feel like natural, organic extensions of the larger plot (like interludes in many great movies and novels).</p><p>Alternately, you can use a travel encounter to launch new story. In a desert, for example, the party might find a camel wearing royal vestments they’ve never seen before. They could appropriate the animal, leaving the vestments to rot in the dust, or they could follow it back to its owners in a thieves’ hideout modeled after the caliphates of old. Exotic adversaries and monsters appearing in unusual terrain are especially evocative of new story. Angels and demons are almost always portents of impending turbulence. A water serpent found in the jungle might indicate a strange migration up a tributary, but why? A young rakshasa found in the arctic might be on a pilgrimage seeking enlightenment, or he could be seeking superior prey to display as a badge of his adulthood.</p><p>Encounters can also feature location traps (see page 338), though these aren’t listed on Table 7.24 because they should be introduced sparingly and only with intent. Location traps should always be introduced as part of the story or setting, even if it’s as simple as them being left over from previous battles or civilizations.</p><p>Planned and Complication encounters won’t always add to the party’s XP reward. Merchants, for example, aren’t adversaries in the traditional sense but rather a chance to restock and perhaps find a few interesting baubles from far-off lands. The same holds for true adversaries that are merely avoided, rather than defeated (see page 337).</p><p>Lastly, it’s bad form to introduce travel encounters when the party has hired safe passage (see page 190). They’ve spent hard-earned silver to ensure a safe trip and you should avoid squandering their purchase without a solid story reason. If you must interrupt their journey, be sure to give them a little help from the Rogues Gallery (e.g. bowmen supporting them from afar or guides, hunters, mercenaries, outriders, or watchmen engaging alongside, generally equal in number to the action dice spent to trigger the Complication).</p><h3>RANDOM TRAVEL ENCOUNTERS</h3><p>If you’d prefer truly random encounters, simply roll 1d20 once during each Downtime period of travel. If the result falls within the range listed below, an encounter occurs.</p><table style=\"text-align:left\"><tbody><tr><td>Aquatic</td><td>1–2</td></tr><tr><td>Arctic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Caverns/Mountains</td><td>1–4</td></tr><tr><td>Desert</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Forest/Jungle</td><td>1–3</td></tr><tr><td>Plains</td><td>1–2</td></tr><tr><td>Swamp</td><td>1–3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This range narrows by 1 if the party secured hired passage (see pages 168 and 190). For example, there’s a 1 in 20 chance of a random encounter in aquatic terrain when using hired passage, or a 1–2 in 20 chance in a swamp, etc.</p><p>You should still decide on the number and types of adversaries, as well as traps and story, in order to tailor them to the party’s ability and the needs of the plot.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1600000,"name":"DISPOSITION","type":"text","_id":"0TGf6DDNyRJm2I0q","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>All sentient beings are guided by their emotions; indeed, they’re often slaves to them. They trust and doubt, love, hate, and ignore. Every relationship is different and informs actions and reactions. Fantasy Craft handles all this with Disposition.</p><p>Every character has a Disposition toward every other character — a modifier ranging from +25 to –25. Most Dispositions start at +0 (Neutral). Higher values indicate affection and trust while lower values translate to dislike and doubt. A character’s Disposition modifier is applied to any check targeting him that relies on his emotional investment in the acting character, such as Bluff, Haggle, Impress, or Investigate/Canvass. It is not applied to Intimidate and Sense Motive checks, which don’t rely on the target’s opinion.</p><p>Disposition has another effect, as shown on Table 7.26: Disposition (see page 378). First, when you want to randomly determine whether an NPC helps someone without being prompted, you can roll 1d20. If the result is equal to or less than the number in the Assistance column, the NPC offers aid; otherwise, he doesn’t. This number can also be used when you want an NPC to randomly choose sides — equal to or lower and the NPC helps a character (or the character’s side); higher and the NPC goes the other way. As with successful Persuade and Coerce checks, PCs and villains may ignore an Assistance result by spending 1 action die.</p><p>A character’s Disposition modifier can change in a variety of ways, most notably successful Influence and Browbeat checks (see pages 74 and 75). Player characters and villains are somewhat resistant to suggestion and changes to their Disposition may be only half as effective if they desire (rounding in their favor).</p><p><em>Example:</em> Lord Bloodpyre negotiates with Bwarg the Goblin King to reestablish the alliance between his tribe and the tiny quivering ones. Both are special characters. Bloodpyre begins with a successful Browbeat check, mentioning the awful losses the goblins have suffered since the alliance was broken. His result would normally improve Bwarg’s Disposition (toward Bloodpyre’s tribe) by 5 but since the Goblin King is a special character his Disposition only rises by 2.</p><p>Bwarg later attempts to smooth-talk Bloodpyre, Impressing him with what the goblin hopes are favorable terms. He doesn’t realize Bloodpyre secretly needs the talks to go well to retain his tribe standing (Bloodpyre made a strong display of not wanting anything to do with the goblins to potentially improve his bidding position), so when his Impress result changes Bloodpyre’s by a whopping 8, Bloodpyre accepts the full adjustment.</p><h4> Table 7.26: Disposition</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Disposition</th><th>Attitude</th><th>Assistance *</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">+21 to +25</td><td>Devoted</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">+16 to +20</td><td>Supportive</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">+11 to +15</td><td>Friendly</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">+6 to +10</td><td>Intrigued</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">+5 to –5</td><td>Neutral</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">–6 to –10</td><td>Cold</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">–11 to –15</td><td>Unfriendly</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">–16 to –20</td><td>Hostile</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">–21 to –25</td><td>Adversarial</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><p> * If the endeavor involves serious risk (e.g. combat), this number drops to 1/2 (rounded down).</p><h2>ATTITUDE</h2><p>When a character’s Disposition shifts into a new range on Table 7.26, his Attitude is adjusted. This is important because Attitudes are lasting where Dispositions fade given time for reflection. At the end of each scene, a character’s Disposition sets to the number within his current range closest to Neutral.</p><p><em>Example:</em> At the end of the first summit, Bloodpyre’s Disposition (toward the goblins) is +18 and Bwarg’s Disposition (toward Bloodpyre’s tribe) is +7. As the scene ends, Bloodpyre’s Attitude settles to Supportive and Bwarg’s Attitude settles to Intrigued. The negotiations will continue. Soon, there will be attempts to Persuade and Coerce tribute between the tribes, which is potentially where it’ll get messy. Pray for folk in the region.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, a character’s Attitude may not adjust more than 1 grade in either direction during each scene.</p><h3>WHAT DO THE ATTITUDES MEAN?</h3><p>Attitudes affect various rules throughout Fantasy Craft, most notably Bluff, Haggle, Impress, and Investigate checks. Here are some pointers for roleplaying them. Player characters are subject to Disposition as well and you should award action dice to those who take this responsibility seriously.</p><p><strong>Devoted:</strong> The character reveres or worships the subject, or is madly in love with them.</p><p><strong>Supportive:</strong> The character cherishes the subject as a dear friend and misses them when they’re apart for any length of time. In a romantic liaison, the character is fascinated, bordering on what might be called “love.”</p><p><strong>Friendly:</strong> The character is close with the subject, or wants to be. He looks for chances for them to meet and misses the subject when they’re not together for longer than a couple weeks. In a romantic liaison, the character is attracted and wants to learn more.</p><p><strong>Intrigued:</strong> The character is fond of the subject and enjoys spending time with them. He doesn’t seek the subject out, however — their relationship is limited to casual meetings unless the subject feels more strongly. If the liaison is romantic, the character’s interest in the subject is budding but uncertain.</p><p><strong>Neutral:</strong> The character is ambivalent toward the subject of his Disposition. His opinions and judgments are based on his personal beliefs as he’s developed no personal feelings toward the subject. He only gets involved in the subject’s affairs when his Alignment or other factors compel him to do so.</p><p><strong>Cold:</strong> The character is aloof and distant around the subject. His Attitude might be the result of mistrust or dislike but it’s not strong enough for the character act against the subject without cause. Mostly he just ignores the subject and hopes the favor is returned.</p><p><strong>Unfriendly:</strong> The character actively dislikes the subject and doesn’t pass up an opportunity to act against them but he probably doesn’t hate them, especially if it’s against his Alignment to do so.</p><p><strong>Hostile:</strong> The character hates the subject and goes out of his way to make trouble for them. He usually stops just short of physical violence and breaking laws, though — unless it’s a sure bet he won’t be caught.</p><p><strong>Adversarial:</strong> The character does everything in his power to hurt the subject, up to and including murder.</p><h2>ROUSING THE MASSES</h2><p>Actions don’t happen in a vacuum — they impact everyone who witnesses them, subtly swaying their opinions. Most of the time there’s no need to track these Disposition changes as they’re both too small to affect Attitudes and immaterial to the overall story. Occasionally, however, someone will do something so kind (or so divisive) that everyone watching (and potentially everyone hearing about it after) may instantly shift their stance. In these cases, you can automatically adjust the Attitude of each standard character who witnesses the act (in the appropriate direction). PCs and villains are also adjusted unless they make a successful Will save (DC 12). They may not spend action dice to avoid this effect.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Toward the end of their summit, Bwarg takes a chance and reminds Bloodpyre of his weaknesses (see page 373). The words are caustic and heard by the assembled tribes, which Bloodpyre can’t abide. With one fell swing of his mighty great axe (and a lucky critical hit), Bloodpyre severs Bwarg’s offending head and raises it so all the goblins can view their king’s final, stunned expression. This could really go either way, the GM automatically shifting the goblins’ Attitudes by 1 in either direction, but with the orc tribe present he decides to adjust it favorably (from Intrigued to Friendly). Bloodpyre has new followers! They quiver too much for his liking but they’re also small enough to make exceptional spies. Pray for everyone in the region.</p><h2>ALLIES AND ENEMIES</h2><p>The transition from ally to enemy is gradual — at least two scenes (the time required to go from Intrigued to Cold and viceversa), which offers plenty of time to roleplay such changes. When an ally or Neutral character becomes an enemy, you should probably also total his XP (just in case).</p><h2>CONTACTS</h2><p>Contacts are long-term allies whose Disposition toward the character must remain at least Supportive at all times (see page 191). Should a Contact’s Disposition drop below this threshold — perhaps because the character abused their trust or needlessly endangered them — the character must give the Contact up, regaining the Prize slot. Reputation invested in the Contact is not regained, however.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1700000,"name":"MORALE AND SUBPLOTS","type":"text","_id":"LMC0sH27N4ZdGCwL","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>MORALE</h1><p>Fantasy adventure is fraught with peril — terrifying dragons, hordes of savage humanoids, and devastating magic can rattle even the stoutest heroes to their core.

Much of this “personal baggage” is handled with Subplots, which let one or more players identify elements of the ongoing story and/or incidental play as important or interesting to them. This alerts you to include more of those elements, giving the characters a chance to expand and advance their individual stories without interrupting the regular flow of play. Even better, these experiences create new objectives, offering the whole party another way to earn XP.</p><h2>NOMINATING POTENTIAL SUBPLOTS</h2><p>This optional system lets anyone introduce secondary objectives based on things they think are cool in the game. Anyone can nominate anything as a Potential Subplot, even you (the GM). You can even introduce Subplot ideas in advance, just to see how the players react to them (this is essentially tentative foreshadowing, which is more fully discussed on page 332).</p><p>Potential Subplots can come up anytime — even during character creation — though at first it’s probably best that everyone simply be aware of them and how they work. Most of the time, opportunities will become apparent in play. The party will take a liking to an NPC or a story point (“This guy’s a jerk. I like him.”), they’ll notice something about their character(s) that isn’t explained or might lead to interesting adventures (“Anyone else wonder why the constable in every city seems to hate us?”), or they’ll get themselves into a situation that’s best resolved alongside the main plot (“Really? That was a loan?”). Subplot suggestions can be clinical (“That treasure hunter seems like a good Rival.”), sarcastic (“No really, that guy’s a jerk.”), or roleplayed (“You, sir, are an interesting fellow. Would you care for some traveling companions?”).</p><p>However a nomination comes up, every player automatically gets the chance to suggest ideas you might incorporate into the Subplot story: “Maybe the constables are on the take!”, “You think these loan sharks have duped other parties like this?”, “I hope this guy doesn’t turn out to be another brigand in disguise!”, and so on. Every player who makes a suggestion that piques your interest earns a bonus action die. This step is entirely optional and you shouldn’t pressure the players to offer ideas. Provide the opportunity and if anything sparks, all the better. Ideas can also come later, as play continues, but each player can only earn one action die per Potential Subplot no matter how many ideas he contributes.</p><p>Your group can nominate as many Potential Subplots as they like but you shouldn’t let it interrupt the regular flow of play. The process should always be organic and last only as long as everyone is having fun suggesting ideas. Jot those down and get back to the adventure in progress as soon as you can.</p><h2>SUBPLOT OBJECTIVES</h2><p>Nominating a Subplot doesn’t make it real — only you, the GM, can do that. When you sit down to build an upcoming adventure, take a look at your Potential Subplot notes and ask yourself which, if any, might work as part of the plot. Strong candidates should suggest one or more objectives, which in turn generate XP for success (see page 337). Sometimes, a Subplot will naturally become the backbone of an entire adventure, or even a series of adventures. This is fine, so long as everyone is having fun. If one or more players seem put out, you might want to focus on their characters’ Subplots soon, or let the Subplots take a back seat in your game. </p><p>No matter what ideas were suggested, Subplot stories are ultimately up to you. This lets you merge them fluidly with the rest of the ongoing story and also gives you the chance to shock and surprise the players with plot twists. So long as you stay true to the Subplot’s inspiration (e.g. avoid radically changing an NPC the players like or twisting a plot the players see as heroic into a moral or ethical quagmire), you can develop Subplots in very much the same way as any other adventure seed.</p><p>Subplot objectives should always involve the entire party, even when the supporting story focuses on a single character. For example, a Chosen character might be charged by divine forces to defend the kingdom from a dark counterpart, but that doesn’t mean his story can’t expand to include his allies. The dark champion might amass an army, prompting the king to enlist the rest of the party as generals in a brutal war. Alternately, it might become clear that the character’s destiny lies in vanquishing the dark champion, who resides at the heart of a deadly dungeon. In both these cases the character needs the entire party’s help to succeed, and everyone has a chance to shine and gain experience in the process.</p><p>You can integrate as many Subplots as you like into each adventure, though at first you should stick to just one (if you use Subplots at all). Unless you’re used to running epic character dramas with lots of diverging storylines, it’s probably not a great idea to include more than three or four.</p><h2>ENDING SUBPLOTS</h2><p>Like any story, a Subplot must eventually end. The length of a Subplot is entirely up to you, and should depend entirely on the amount of fun the group is having with it. One Subplot might last for months or even years of game time and wind up something you and your friends discuss about long after the campaign is over. Another might fizzle at the nomination stage, never making it into actual play. Most will be featured in an adventure or two and then close out, maybe with fanfare and a true climax, maybe not.</p><p>Initially you’re the gauge of which Subplots to include and how integral to make them to the game’s story (though you’re acting on nominations shared by the entire group, which should give you a few ideas about what they might like to see). You might see a lot of potential in a Subplot, brainstorming several adventures ahead, or you might only see it as a one-off. Follow your instinct but try to make sure that when a Subplot doesn’t end in the next adventure the characters at least have some satisfactory closure.</p><p>Following the objectives example in the last section, you might <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\">set up the next adventure against the dark champion to resolve with a pivotal battle at the edge of the kingdom, (presumably) with the party successfully routing the enemy’s troops. The dark champion still lives and the Chosen character’s destiny is not yet fulfilled but the heroes win the day and you can let the plot settle into the background for a while.</span></p><p>In these ideal cases, after each adventure in which one or more Subplots are featured with a degree of closure, ask the party whether they want to see that plot continue. If they do, keep your notes and watch for more chances to work Subplot objectives into future adventures. If not, then focus on other things and let that story fade away. Take a vote if the party can’t reach consensus on their own, with the Subplot character breaking a tie.</p><p>Ending a Subplot is still an option even when closure isn’t achieved but it may demand that you resolve the story off screen. For example, if the party failed to fight back the dark champion’s forces and no one wanted to see that Subplot again, you might explain during Downtime or in the next session’s introduction that the king’s allies rallied and won the day later. Alternately, the dark champion’s forces could fall back without explanation, perhaps re-igniting interest in the Subplot.</p><p>Again, what’s important is that every Subplot runs only as long as it’s welcome, and that it gets the sendoff the group wants for it. Anything else and the Subplot becomes a burden rather than a way for players to personalize the campaign’s storyline.</p><h2>SUBPLOT CONSIDERATIONS</h2><p>First and foremost, Subplots are optional. Only players interested in enriching their characters’ stories should introduce them, and you should only pursue them if you’re interested in adding more player-driven content to adventures.</p><p>Second, Subplots are collaborative. Even though you get to choose whether each Potential Subplot makes it into future adventures (and how), the players get to choose whether an unresolved Subplot should continue. Everyone has the chance to contribute ideas. All the players and all their characters are involved, even when the story focuses on just one or two of them. Without this shared responsibility and care, Subplots can easily become distracting or even annoying. In these cases it’s critical that you consult those who aren’t engaging with a Subplot and discern the source of their disinterest. Many times you can adjust the Subplot to get everyone’s juices flowing but when you can’t it might be best to retire the story and move on.</p><p>Third, Subplots are unobtrusive. These rules only demand attention at very specific times (when someone notices something intriguing or takes note of someone else’s interest, as you build an adventure, and after an adventure when Subplots appear). Just as important, everyone’s involved when they come up in play. Potential Subplot nominations take advantage of table chatter that happens anyway, and Subplot objectives are (or should be) tailored to challenge the whole party instead of just one or two characters.</p><p>Finally, Subplots are yours to modify and mutate as you like. The following list is merely a set of suggestions to get you started. Your list might splice or merge Subplots, add or remove rules, introduce new and exciting objectives… The sky’s the limit!</p><h4>CHOSEN</h4><p>One or more characters have a calling. It might be handed down by a god, a church, the people, voices no one else can hear, or just a feeling, but the character(s) are charged with a duty they can’t ignore (though they might try). Chosen characters are often guided by or caught up in prophesy.</p><p>Potential objectives can include anything Chosen characters must do on the path to fulfilling their destiny: saving innocents, defending locations, converting the faithless, and maybe even discovering the nature of the obligation in the first place. Adversaries are almost always enemies of the group or force guiding the characters, such as disciples of a rival deity or religion, the people of an opposing region, or adventurers compelled by equally enigmatic and mutually exclusive power.</p><h4>CRISIS OF FAITH</h4><p>The faith of one or more characters is shaken, perhaps because they question their religion’s values or maybe because they experience something that contradicts them. Now they search for a fresh direction and watch for meaning in everything they see and everyone they meet.</p><p>Potential objectives can include learning about newly encountered faiths and making tough ethical and moral choices with lasting impact on the world. Adversaries exclusive to this Subplot are rare though members of the characters’ former faith might take it upon themselves to antagonize or undermine the party. Conversely, followers of opposing religions might court the characters with false promises of spiritual bounty, more interested in corrupting their souls than saving them. </p><p>In any campaign, a character caught in a Crisis of Faith is considered a traitor to his beliefs and the Dispositions of characters with his former Alignment decrease by 10 when they realize his state of mind. In a campaign with the miracles quality, several special rules apply (see page 309).</p><h4>CURSED</h4><p>One or more characters are victims of a curse inflicted by a spellcaster, a monster, blind fate, or cosmic coincidence. The curse might have specific consequences (e.g. dooming the characters to loveless lives or turning friends to enemies), it might inflict a permanent injury (–1 wound), or it might doom them to constant misfortune (+1 error range with checks or 1 fewer starting action dice).</p><p>Potential objectives usually include learning the source of the curse and taking the steps required to lift it. These steps often involve the character(s) righting their wrongs or satisfying karmic requirements. When a spellcaster, monster or other NPC places the curse, the characters may be able to locate and confront them, and with luck and a little groveling they might even be able to convince them to lift it. Maybe killing them will lift the curse (or maybe it will make it permanent).</p><h4>DEBT</h4><p>One or more characters owe money to dangerous groups or individuals. At a minimum, the Debt should involve more coin than the entire party can raise in a day. Unless owed to charitable sorts, debts often compound unless paid quickly (e.g. doubling each month).</p><p>Potential objectives can involve anything the party has to do to raise the required cash. Alternately, the party can look for ways to satisfy the debt without repaying it (e.g. undertaking jobs for the loaners, or in a less than heroic game eliminating or framing them). As for adversaries, NPCs who loan sizable sums commonly employ hired muscle to “remind” characters of their debt, and make examples of them when time runs out.</p><h4>DEPENDENTS</h4><p>One or more characters are responsible for one or more largely helpless NPCs (e.g. family members, friends, wards, people they’ve rescued who have nowhere to go and no one else to protect them, etc.). Dependents are often recklessly fond of the party, unwittingly following them into spectacularly bad situations, and foolishly curious, getting into remarkable trouble when left alone.</p><p>Potential objectives include all the tasks involved in keeping the dependents safe, whether the threats come from their backgrounds or the party’s adventures. Adversaries can range from hungry monsters the dependents “find” to angry drunks they “console” to con men they trust with the party’s gear and more.</p><h4>HAUNTED</h4><p>One or more characters are plagued by ghosts, visions, or memories that distract and disturb them. Whenever the source of their anguish comes up, the characters suffer a –2 penalty with attack and skill checks.</p><p>Potential objectives include anything that helps put the source of the haunting to rest (e.g. helping a ghost resolve his worldly ills, fulfilling a vision, or righting a wrong the characters can’t forget). Except for spirits, adversaries are uncommon with this Subplot.</p><h4>HUNTED/WANTED </h4><p>One or more characters are on the run from powerful adversaries who want to capture or kill them. The hunters might be individuals acting for their own reasons (Hunted) or emissaries of the law (Wanted). The characters may be guilty of whatever their hunters claim, they might have been framed, or they could just be victims of unfortunate circumstance.</p><p>Potential objectives include evading or eliminating the hunters, but they can also include overcoming obstacles the hunters use to slow them down and challenges that arise in the hunt (e.g. rescuing innocent bystanders, learning new information about the hunters, gaining new allies against them, and clearing their names). The primary adversaries are, of course, the hunters and their allies.</p><h4>MENTOR/PATRON</h4><p>One or more characters answer to a trainer (Mentor) or benefactor (Patron). Their service might be religious (acolytes), martial (squires), or involve an art or craft (apprentices). In any case, their sponsor takes a direct interest in their lives, encouraging or demanding pursuits related to their service.</p><p>Potential objectives can include virtually any task that develops the characters’ skills or supports their backer. Squires might be charged with demonstrating a precise sword technique, or a patron might send his servants to fetch ingredients for his latest culinary concoction — pollywogs found in the deepest, dankest swamp in the land. Adversaries can include anyone or anything opposing their various errands, including Rivals and other beneficiaries of the backer’s gifts. For an interesting twist, give the mentor or patron a Rival or Nemesis of his own — one who competes or threatens him through the characters.</p><h4>MILITARY/POLITICAL ENTANGLEMENT </h4><p>One or more characters are embroiled in large-scale turmoil. They could be in positions of power, in positions of influence near those in power, or just swept up in the chaos. This Subplot can cover war, choosing a successor to the throne, or any other regional or natural issue that places demands on the party. </p><p>Potential objectives include forging and splintering alliances, claiming new or lost territory, winning over supporters, and breaking enemy forces, among many other similar activities. Adversaries can be drawn from the ranks of opposing soldiers or court figures, as appropriate.</p><h4>MISTAKEN IDENTITY</h4><p>One or more characters are mistaken for someone else (e.g. different adventurers, criminals, experts with knowledge the characters lack, etc.). Mistaken identities rarely outlast a single adventure and often promote comic or slapstick situations. They also require a good deal of forethought to handle correctly, as situations must constantly arise to prevent the characters or others in the know from correcting the error.</p><p>Potential objectives can include overcoming challenges facing the persons for whom the characters are mistaken (e.g. saving their loved ones and defeating their enemies), successfully acting like the real persons (when desired or needed), and correcting the error (which is never as simple as merely blurting it out, and is often interrupted by a steady stream of more pressing concerns). Adversaries include the real persons’ enemies and anyone who suspects a ruse and gets in the party’s way.</p><h4>NEMESIS/RIVAL</h4><p>An adversary takes a special interest in one or more characters, wishing to defeat them in any way he can (Nemesis), or best them in some specific fashion, possibly winning the heart of a mutually desired love or proving himself better than the characters in a shared profession (Rival).</p><p>Potential objectives include fighting off a Nemesis’ schemes, winning competitions against a Rival, and ending the hostility. The nemesis or rival is the primary adversary, though he may have many allies and minions.</p><h4>RESCUE</h4><p>One or more characters seek to liberate someone held against their will, possibly a friend, relative, love interest, or party member (which can be useful when a player leaves the game, takes a break, or retires a character to start a new one).</p><p>Potential objectives include locating the captive, penetrating defenses, and escaping with the captive in tow. Adversaries include those guarding the captive and those who took him or her prisoner in the first place.</p><h4>QUEST</h4><p>One or more characters have accepted a crucial but dangerous task (e.g. clearing an area of monsters, bringing fugitives to justice, or reuniting a shattered people). An NPC may have bestowed the task or the characters might have taken it upon themselves. Either way, the Subplot ends when the task is accomplished. Quests sometimes compensate characters, especially when bestowed, but are just as often their own reward.</p><p>Possible objectives include all the demands of the task as well as solving problems that arise while performing it (e.g. destroying a gate through which the monsters are arriving, tracking and apprehending those who helped the fugitives escape, or locating survivors of the shattered civilization and extracting them from their current circumstances). Adversaries are many and varied, depending on the nature of the quest.</p><h4>SEARCH</h4><p>One or more characters are looking for something. It could be an item, lost knowledge, or even a lost love. Clues are fleeting and often wrong, but always lead to new adventure.</p><p>Potential objectives include solving all the problems the clues lead to, a few of which may actually yield important details about what’s been lost. Adversaries might include rival searchers and those who wish the past to remain buried.</p><h4>SECRET IDENTITY</h4><p>One or more characters hide their true identities, possibly because they’re on the run (Hunted/Wanted), or maybe to avoid problems in their real lives.</p><p>Potential objectives always risk revealing the characters’ real identities (e.g. requiring skills not in keeping with their aliases, interacting with characters who know their real names, etc.). Adversaries can include anyone searching for the characters (for reasons left behind in their real lives) and opponents of their aliases.</p><h4>TROUBLED ROMANCE</h4><p>One or more characters are entangled in messy romance, perhaps even with the same love interest. They may crave the interest’s affection or hope to protect them from heartbreak. Troubled romances are often tragic, involving hard choices between love and duty.</p><p>Potential objectives can include scripting and delivering passionate messages, composing and performing heartfelt musical pieces, making a fool (but not acting the fool), sacrificing for love, and similarly grand gestures (they can also include pech cocktails and getting caught in the rain). Adversaries can include rival suitors, protective or objecting family and friends, and meddling enemies who may or may not understand that the characters just want a moment’s peace with the person of their dreams (oh, and kooky romantic ballad singers — them, too).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1800000,"name":"CHEATING DEATH","type":"text","_id":"jG1Pn9i2xw9ZCbr7","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>There’s nothing more humiliating for a hero than an ignoble death — fumbling while climbing a cliff, failing a critical save against an acid pit trap, getting backstabbed by a common (standard) goblin during a Dramatic scene… These aren’t the ways a hero should go out. Fortunately, Fantasy Craft offers a loophole: heroes can often Cheat Death, beating the odds to adventure another day. Like all miracles, though, Cheating Death has a price.</p><p>A character may only Cheat Death once per adventure, and only with your approval. The option shouldn’t be extended to characters whose deaths were reckless, foolhardy, or a result of violating the basic principles of the game (e.g. acting ruthlessly in a heroic game, betraying the party, supporting the enemy, or being disruptive).</p><p>With your approval, the player proposes a plausible reason for his character’s survival, as well as a lasting impact the experience has on his character’s background or the campaign world.</p><p><em>Example:</em> At the conclusion of a daring rescue operation, Brungil holds Lord Bloodpyre’s men off long enough for his companions to escape. He lands a critical hit on the orc but overextends himself, giving Bloodpyre the chance to sink a dagger deep between Brungil’s ribs. Brungil stumbles back and gets hammered with arrows from Bloodpyre’s men, tumbling over the side of a cliff. He disappears in a forest canopy nearly 100 ft. below.</p><p>By the rules, Brungil is good and dead, having suffered enough damage to bring his wounds to –28. This is even enough to pulp his body when it hits the forest floor, but Brungil’s player has another thought. Rootwalkers have yet to make an appearance in this game, so he proposes that the trees he falls through are in fact slumbering NPCs who break his fall and nurse him back to health.</p><p>The GM’s current story deals with Bloodpyre’s tribe expanding its territory, an effort that’s pillaged much of the natural environment and threatens the local fey population. Brungil wagers that the Rootwalkers aren’t happy with the tribe’s actions, and that they might be open to negotiating an alliance with the region’s folk — through Brungil.</p><p>Everyone else at the table, including you, jointly rates these proposals on a scale of 1 (horrible) to 5 (brilliant). These are averaged — added together and divided by the number of people rating the proposals, rounding up — and the result is recorded. It’ll be important in a second.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil’s player is one of four at the table, plus the GM (a total of five). The other three players love the suggested story, rating it 5, 4, and 4, respectively. The GM likes it but is a bit concerned about it being so self-serving, so he rates it a 3. The average rating is 4 (5 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 16, divided by 4).</p><p>The player rolls 1d20 and consults Table 7.28: Cheating Death (see page 386). His character seemingly dies but actually suffers the fate corresponding to the averaged rating (1 being Catastrophic, 2 being Ruinous, 3 being Tragic, 4 being Damaging, and 5 being Petty). His character earns no XP or other rewards for this adventure.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil’s player rolls a 7. The average rating of 4 translates to a Damaging fate, which with a result of 7 on Table 7.28 yields “He [Brungil] is regularly visited by spirits of fallen enemies and suffers a –2 penalty with Morale checks.” The GM jots this down and starts planning.</p><p>The character may return in the next adventure, suffering the listed penalty (if any). <strong>This penalty is permanent</strong> (though the character can sometimes recoup over time, as is the case with lost Renown).</p><p><em>Example:</em> Early into the following adventure, which the GM shifts to several days later to allow Brungil time to heal, the dwarf returns with his Rootwalker saviors. Talks of alliance begin and the party rejoices that their friend survived. A week later, as the alliance is prepping its first retaliatory strikes against Bloodpyre’s tribe, the party is sent to spy on the orcs’ main camp. This is a Dramatic scene and when the party accidentally alerts an orc patrol the GM indulges in a bit of deceptive description, portraying more orcs to Brungil than there were in the patrol. His attacks pass harmlessly through the newcomers, confirming they’re spirits, or visions, or… something, and he recognizes a couple from previous battles. He soon realizes he’s being haunted and if the patrol manages to alert the camp, outnumbering the party many times over with reinforcements, he’ll also suffer the penalty. Both will remain with him for the rest of his career, so he’ll never forget that fateful fall into the arms of the leafy, slumbering giants…</p><p>For heightened drama, the proposal ratings can be recorded secretly and handed to you without the player learning the results. If you also roll on Table 7.28 the player will be completely in the dark about his character’s fate until it’s revealed in play.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The previous example is a great illustration of this tactic’s potential. It would be so much more powerful if Brungil had returned without the player knowing his fate — if he’d put it together himself on that battlefield, as orcs seemingly appeared from nowhere… Even the fact that he’s haunted wouldn’t necessarily reveal the penalty. With five possible fates, the player would be left guessing until a Morale trigger came up.</p><p>With your approval, a character may Cheat Death more than once. All fate effects are cumulative.</p><h2>NPCS CHEATING DEATH</h2><p>Villains and certain other NPCs can also Cheat Death, generally at the cost of 4 GM action dice. When an NPC Cheats Death, the players don’t vote; rather, you roll 1d20 for the general result and 1d4+1 for the NPC’s specific fate. Again, it’s often best to keep these results secret — the GM doesn’t even need to announce he’s spending the dice — so the villain’s survival can be revealed as a surprise down the line.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Turning the tables for a second, what if Bloodpyre had been sent plunging off that cliff instead? The GM could spend 4 action dice and roll a d20 and a d4 to find that he survived the fall an amnesiac (Rootwalker magic at work?), or without Contacts (and thus expelled from the tribe, perhaps to be come an unlikely ally against the orcs’ new leader), or with a reduced Constitution score (a weakness the party can exploit in an upcoming adventure). The possibilities are limitless.</p><h4>Table 7.28: Cheating Death</h4><table style=\"text-align:left\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:80px\">Result</th><th>Fate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><p>The character returns with a story to tell. <br />1.

Once per scene, the GM may spend 2 action dice to cause him to become enraged. <br />3. Tragic: He develops a phobia. Once per scene, the GM may spend 1 action die to cause him to become frightened. <br />4. Damaging: He’s more easily overwhelmed. Once per scene, the GM may spend 1 action die to cause him to become slowed for 1d6 rounds. <br />5. Petty: He’s moody, perhaps brooding, which actually earns him points with some (like emotionally immature sexual partners).</p></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><p>The character returns with spiritual scars. <br />1. Catastrophic: He becomes despondent and lethargic, gaining the fatigued I condition. <br />2. Ruinous: His sadness is crushing, decreasing his Wisdom score by 2. <br />3. Tragic: His melancholy impacts his ability to bounce back after a fight. His natural healing rate decreases to 1/2 normal (rounded up). <br />4. Damaging: His determination wanes. His base Will save bonus decreases by 2. <br />5. Petty: He’s depressed and sullen, perhaps prone to alcoholism or drug abuse.</p></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><p>The character returns to find his next of kin have started liquidating his assets. <br />1. Catastrophic: Too late! All his worldly possessions are gone, including all coin, gear, and physical Prizes (he retains his Contacts). <br />2. Ruinous: All but my…! All his coin, his full Stake, all his gear, and half his Prizes excluding Contacts (GM’s choice) are lost. <br />3. Tragic: Those greedy gits! All his coin, his full Stake, and all his gear have been claimed, donated, or sold. His retains his Prizes. <br />4. Damaging: Could have been worse! All his coin and half his Stake have been donated to a local church. He retains his gear and Prizes. <br />5. Petty: Just in time! He retains his coin, gear, and Prizes but gains no Income next adventure.</p></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><p>The character actually returns from the dead… and he’s not alone. <br />1. Catastrophic: He’s a subconscious conduit for violent spirits craving death and destruction. When he sleeps, the GM can spend 1 action die to have them slip through his dreams and into the waking world, lingering just long enough to kill a standard NPC the character’s encountered in the last 24 hours. Alternately, the GM can spend 2 action dice to kill a special NPC the character’s encountered in the same period. The murders are brutal and all evidence points to the character as the culprit (this is, of course, because they look like the character, possess the same weapons, and use the same tactics). It gets worse if the character dies — his body explodes in a nimbus of hellfire, inflicting 1d6 divine damage per Career Level with a blast increment of 1 square. This also releases a small army of the spirits (1 per Career Level), each a standard Ghostly NPC (max. 75 XP), freeing them to murder at will — starting with the rest of the party. <br />2. Ruinous: He’s hunted by servants of a malevolent god he escaped in the afterlife. Once per adventure the GM may spend 2 action dice to attack the character with a single special Ghostly NPC or a mob of standard Ghostly NPCs (max. 100 XP). He may spend additional action dice for Reinforcements (see page 368). The GM is encouraged to build one or more of these NPCs in advance to have them ready and maintain continuity. If the NPCs kill the character, they drag his soul to their master, forever preventing the possibility of another return (even via resurrection). <br />3. Tragic: He’s harassed by a malicious spirit in moments of mortal danger. He suffers a –2 penalty with attack and skill checks during Dramatic scenes. <br />4. Damaging: He’s regularly visited by spirits of fallen enemies and suffers a –2 penalty with Morale checks. <br />5. Petty: He periodically sees the spirits of dead friends and relatives, who offer cryptic and sometimes infuriating “advice.”</p></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><p>The character returns without apparent incident — but Fate isn’t done with him. <br />1. Catastrophic: His spark of heroism flickers like a candle on the coast. His starting action dice decrease by 2 (min. 0). <br />2. Ruinous: He and his party will be chasing that rainbow for a long, long time. His party suffers a –10 penalty with Treasure Rolls. <br />3. Tragic: His margin for error is particularly slim. His action dice never explode. <br />4. Damaging: Even when he sets his mind to something, it can still go wrong. He suffers a –1 penalty with action die rolls. <br />5. Petty: He’s plagued by minor mishaps: dice and cards never favor him, people spill drinks on him, and so on.</p></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><p>The character returns with a significant physical injury. <br />1. Catastrophic: He loses a hand or arm. He can no longer use 2-handed gear and suffers a –4 penalty with Dex-based skill checks (among other obvious effects). <br />2. Ruinous: He loses a foot or leg. His Speed decreases by 10 ft. he can no longer Run. <br />3. Tragic: He loses an eye, suffering a –4 penalty with ranged attacks and visual Notice and Search checks. <br />4. Damaging: He’s partially deaf, suffering a –4 penalty with auditory Notice and Search checks. <br />5. Petty: He loses his sense of smell.</p></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><p>The character returns to a… complicated personal life. <br />1. Catastrophic: He becomes a social leper, unable to acquire new Contacts. <br />2. Ruinous: His social network has collapsed into spiteful infighting. The character loses all his Contacts. <br />3. Tragic: He’s blamed for everything — even things he couldn’t possibly have done. The Dispositions of all characters drop by 10 when they learn who he is. <br />4. Damaging: One of his close friends is nowhere to be found. The character loses 1 Contact (GM’s choice) <br />5. Petty: Everyone’s moved on, resulting in cascading repercussions. Allies and family speak candidly — perhaps too candidly — about their fallen friend. Lover(s) find comfort in new arms. When the character returns, chaos and hilarity ensue.</p></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><p>The character returns to find his social standing tarnished. <br />1. Catastrophic: Any prestige he once enjoyed is gone. He loses all Reputation and Renown. (among other obvious effects). <br />2. Ruinous: Now he fights for every kindness. His Reputation costs increase by 50% (rounded up). <br />3. Tragic: The slander makes rebuilding his good name an uphill battle. His Legend decreases by 2. <br />4. Damaging: He recoups, but not without social injury. He loses 50 Reputation (or, if he has less, he loses 1 Renown). <br />5. Petty: His enemies seize the opportunity to spread lies about him, resulting in countless unfortunate assumptions and misconceptions.</p></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><p>The character returns a celebrity — and it only gets worse from there. <br />1. Catastrophic: Even when disguised, he tends to attract passionate neophytes hoping to “learn from the master.” Once per adventure the GM may spend 2 action dice to introduce an overprotective, overzealous standard NPC seeking to become the character’s new apprentice (max. 50 XP, built by the GM or chosen by him from the Rogues Gallery). This NPC “helps” the party in every way possible (whether they ask or not), up to and including attacking the party’s enemies, attempting critical skill checks, and wandering ahead to “scout the area.” Unfortunately, the party earns no XP for anything the NPC accomplishes for them, and should he die or be sent away, the party earns no Reputation for the adventure. <br />2. Ruinous: Even when disguised, he’s routinely swarmed by oblivious sycophants. Once per adventure the GM may spend 1 or more action dice to introduce the same number of doting admirer mobs (max. 40 XP, built by the GM or chosen by him from the Rogues Gallery). These admirers follow the party around, vying for the character’s attention and generally getting in the way (they also prevent the party from adopting disguises of any kind). Should any of the admirers die or be sent away, the character earns no Reputation for the adventure. <br />3. Tragic: Even when disguised, he’s regularly attacked by rivals wanting to claim his celebrity as their own. Once per adventure the GM may spend 1 action die to attack the character with a single special NPC or a mob of standard NPCs (max. 100 XP). He may spend additional action dice for Reinforcements (see page 368). The GM is encouraged to build one or more of these NPCs in advance to have them ready and maintain continuity. <br />4. Damaging: Unless Disguised, he’s automatically recognized (see page 73). Also, his Holdings are constantly full of doting admirers, taking up half the maximum guest capacity (rounded up). <br />5. Petty: Unless Disguised, he’s regularly pestered by inquisitive scribes, fawning fans, needy nobles, and other annoyances.</p></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><p>The character returns with an allergy to a common species or substance (GM’s choice). <br />1. Catastrophic: When he’s within 30 ft. of his allergy trigger for more than a round, he must make a Will save (DC 18) each round or begin suffocating (see page 217). Once the character fails a save, he can only breathe again when he moves more than 30 ft. away. <br />2. Ruinous: When he’s within 30 ft. of his allergy trigger for more than a round, he must make a Will save (DC 16) each round or suffer 1 temporary Con impairment. <br />3. Tragic: When he’s within 30 ft. of his allergy trigger for more than a minute, he must make a Will save (DC 14) each round or suffer 1d6 lethal damage. <br />4. Damaging: When he’s within 30 ft. of his allergy trigger for more than a minute, he must make a Will save (DC 12) each round or become sickened for 1 round. <br />5. Petty: His eyes water and his nose runs when he’s near his allergy trigger for more than a few minutes.</p></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><p>The character returns with a weakness. <br />1. Catastrophic: His massive damage threshold against 1 type or from 1 source (GM’s choice) decreases to 25 points (see page 208). <br />2. Ruinous: He suffers double damage of 1 type or from 1 source (GM’s choice). <br />3. Tragic: He suffers a –2 penalty with saves against stress or subdual damage (GM’s choice). <br />4. Damaging: He suffers a –2 penalty with saves against spells and other magic effects. <br />5. Petty: He suffers excruciating pain — but no penalties — from hits inflicting 1 damage type or from 1 source (GM’s choice).</p></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><p>The character isn’t quite as brawny when he returns. <br />1. Catastrophic: His error ranges with unarmed and melee attacks increase by 2. <br />2. Ruinous: His Strength score drops by 2. <br />3. Tragic: Damage reduction is twice as effective against the character’s attacks. <br />4. Damaging: His suffers a –2 penalty with unarmed and melee damage. <br />5. Petty: He’s noticeably scrawny, lacking much of his former bulk.</p></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><p>The character isn’t quite as quick on his feet when he returns. <br />1. Catastrophic: He gains the flat-footed condition. <br />2. Ruinous: His Dexterity score drops by 2. <br />3. Tragic: His base Initiative bonus decreases by 4. <br />4. Damaging: His base Reflex save bonus decreases by 2 <br />5. Petty: He’s noticeably less agile and prone to minor physical foibles.</p></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><p>The character is a bit more fragile when he returns. <br />1. Catastrophic: His maximum vitality decreases to 1/2 standard (rounded down). <br />2. Ruinous: His Constitution score drops by 2. <br />3. Tragic: Poisons and diseases affect him twice as fast (1/2 Incubation Period) and twice as severely (doubled effect). <br />4. Damaging: His base Fortitude save bonus decreases by 2. <br />5. Petty: He’s pallid and gaunt, his features sunken.</p></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><p>The character’s mind isn’t quite as sharp when he returns. <br />1. Catastrophic: Skill ranks cost twice as many skill points for him. <br />2. Ruinous: His Intelligence score drops by 2. <br />3. Tragic: He’s often exploited at market. His silver prices increase by 25% (rounded up). <br />4. Damaging: He suffers a –2 penalty with Int-based skill checks. <br />5. Petty: He’s sometimes slow on the uptake, taking an extra moment to gather his wits.</p></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><p>The character looks the same but something’s just not right. <br />1. Catastrophic: He’s like a whole new person. The GM and player take turns selecting class levels to replace the character’s previous choices. The GM chooses first. <br />2. Ruinous: His talents aren’t the same. The GM and player take turns selecting feats to replace the character’s previous choices. The GM chooses first. <br />3. Tragic: He specializes in different activities. The GM and player take turns investing his skill ranks to replace the character’s previous choices. The GM chooses first. <br />4. Damaging: He pursues new things. The GM and player take turns selecting new Interests to replace the character’s previous choices, including Alignment. The GM chooses first. <br />5. Petty: His mannerisms are different (e.g. he speaks with a new accent, makes uncharacteristic gestures, etc.).</p></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><p>The character returns a changed… person? <br />1. Catastrophic: The character comes back as the party remembers him but over time he… changes. Once per adventure, during a period of Downtime or when the character sleeps, the GM may introduce any 1 NPC type or quality by spending a number of action dice equal to the XP cost. This process continues as long as the GM wishes <br />2. Ruinous: He periodically shapeshifts, losing control of his transformed body. He doesn’t remember what he does while shifted, though he may suffer the consequences. Once per adventure the GM may spend 2 action dice to trigger the transformation and take control of the character for up to 12 hours. Ideally, this should happen during Downtime or between adventures so the player isn’t left out of the game. The GM determines what happens in the intervening time. If needed, he can build the character’s alternate shape using the NPC construction rules (max. 100 XP). <br />3. Tragic: He gains the Beast Type (see page 226) and a natural attack of the GM’s choice in place of his hands. <br />4. Damaging: Non-adversary animals fear him and flee whenever possible. He can’t ride an animal, even if it’s trained. <br />5. Petty: He gains a disturbing but harmless characteristic that’s “alien” to his species (e.g. tentacles in place of fingers).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1550000,"name":"Table 7.24: Travel

{"name":"Chapter 5: Combat","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"COMBAT","type":"text","_id":"DzHluKgf2bRzbYYS","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>At the very heart of every fantasy odyssey is the fierce, personal struggle of one adventuring party against the world. Over the course of a party’s career, it fights through harrowing dungeons, remote wilderness, and all the dark and forgotten corners of cities, vanquishing foes for glory, gold, and occasionally the gratitude of those saved and satisfied. Yet it’s not just about the accolades and the rewards — in a truly great Fantasy Craft campaign, every battle becomes its own thrilling, memorable experience. Every swing of bone and steel, every speeding arrow shifts the face of the battlefield, and every wound is another chance for victory. Parties dreams of such thrilling encounters, but how do you make them a reality?</p><p>The Fantasy Craft combat system is streamlined to keep the focus on the characters and their enemies, helping them direct and define the action through a series of fast and furious exchanges. No character is without something to do and everyone contributes to the escalating conflict until the explosive conclusion. It all starts with knowing where everyone is and what they’re carrying.</p><h1>SETTING UP</h1><p>The circumstances of most fights are determined by the situation leading into them. Someone throw a punch at one of the characters in a tavern? You already know the locale and the positions of two of the combatants, and that both are aware of each other. The characters stumble on a monster in its lair? Whether the monster and characters know about each other has probably been determined by skill checks leading up to the fight, which should inform the characters’ locations and how they’re approaching the lair (not to mention whether the monster is ready for them when they get there). A party that sets an ambush will be happy to explain what it’s got planned...</p><p>At the start of each combat, it’s the GM’s job to answer three questions: Where is everyone? What’s everyone carrying? And are any participants unaware of any of the others? Some additional details may also be required, such as the effectiveness of an ambush (see page 83), special terrain (see page 204), and the locations of important items, but those three questions set up the basics. The GM may choose to poll the players about their characters’ locations and carried items, especially if they’re given an opportunity to act before the combat starts, but he probably shouldn’t let them determine their awareness unless they start the fight themselves. Also, when playing without a battle mat, tracking distances between characters is plenty.</p><h1>THE ORDER OF COMBAT</h1><p>Each combat is carried out in four steps, as follows.</p><h2>STEP 1: FLAT FOOTEDNESS</h2><p>Unless a character intentionally enters a combat after it begins, he begins the fight flat-footed. This means that he loses his Dexterity bonus to Defense (if positive), as well as all dodge bonuses to Defense. He might also be vulnerable to a number of special attacks and effects. A character stops being flat-footed as soon as he takes any half or full action, or immediately after he’s hit.</p><h2>STEP 2: INITIATIVE</h2><p>Each character rolls 1d20 and adds his Initiative bonus (see page 61). The result is the character’s Initiative Count. A character cannot score a threat or error with an Initiative check.</p><p>The GM may either make one Initiative check for all opponents, or separate the opponents into groups and make an Initiative check for each. The first option makes things run faster, but it can unbalance combat, especially if the opponents’ Initiative Count is particularly high or low.</p><h2>STEP 3: SURPRISE ROUND</h2><p>If any combatants are unaware of the others, a surprise round happens. Each combatant who is aware of one or more other combatants gets to take 1 free action, 1 half action, or 1 full action during this round. A character who takes a full action may not break it into 2 half actions, nor may any character take more than 1 free action during a surprise round.</p><p>Surprise round actions occur from highest to lowest Initiative Count and are subject to all standard combat rules.</p><h2>STEP 4: COMBAT ROUNDS</h2><p>The remainder of each combat occurs in combat rounds, each of which lasts 6 seconds. During each combat round, characters may act from highest to lowest Initiative Count. When two or more characters’ Initiative Counts are equal, the character with the highest Initiative bonus acts first. If both characters’ Initiative bonuses are the same as well, the characters each roll 1d20, rerolling ties, and the character with the highest result acts first throughout the combat.</p><p>When a character gets the chance to act, he may take either <strong>1 full action</strong> or <strong>2 half actions</strong> (for a list of standard actions, see page 218). Most characters may also take a variety of other actions using skills, class and feat abilities, and other character options.</p><p>Additionally, if the character doesn’t take any Movement action during the round he may take a Bonus 5-ft. Step, moving 5 ft. in any direction (for more about movement, see page 204).</p><p>Finally, he can take any number of free actions, which are trivial, effortless activities that don’t affect the character’s ability to take his full or half actions during the round. Typical free actions include talking, performing simple gestures, and dropping something.</p><p>The GM may limit the number of free actions a character can take under certain circumstances. The following general rules apply to actions taken during combat.</p><p>• Skill checks may carry over from round to round. For instance, a character may take a half action to move and follow up with a full-action Disable check, in which case the check is resolved at the end of his first half action in the second round. This option is not available for combat actions, which must be completed in the round they begin.</p><p>• A character can combine 2 half actions gained from different sources to take 1 full action. All restrictions placed on either or both half actions apply to the resulting full action. For example, if the Surge of Speed feat is combined with another half action to take a full action, that full action may not be an attack.</p><p>• Some rules reduce the time it takes to perform an action, but each individual action may only be affected by one such rule at a time.</p><h1>MOVEMENT</h1><p>With each Standard Move action (see page 218), a character may move a number of feet equal to his Speed, meaning that a character who spends both his half actions during a round moving can cover twice this distance. Most characters possess a Speed of 30 ft., though some may vary due to Species, encumbrance, armor, and other factors. For ease of play, all movement is broken down into 5-ft. increments, so no character may move less than 5 ft. at a time.</p><p>Again, if a character doesn’t take any Movement action during a round he may take a Bonus 5-ft. Step, moving 5 ft. in any direction. This step may be taken at any time during the character’s Initiative Count — before, during, or after any of the character’s other actions. Once a character takes a Bonus 5-ft. Step, though, he cannot take any other Movement action during the same round (for a list of Movement actions, see page 218).</p><p>A character may freely move through areas occupied by allies and teammates but restrictions apply when he’s close to opponents.</p><p>• A character who’s within 5 ft. of an opponent is considered adjacent to him.</p><p>• Any character who moves into an area adjacent to an opponent must stop moving, unless that opponent is flatfooted or unable to attack him.</p><p>• While adjacent to one or more opponents, a character may only move by taking a Bonus 5-ft. Step, making a Tumble check (see page 69), or taking a Standard Move action in which the first 10 ft. of movement does not leave him adjacent to any opponent.</p><p>The GM may sometimes apply Speed modifiers when a character moves through difficult terrain, such as mud, snow, or cluttered areas. Speed modifiers usually consume 10 or even 15 ft. of Speed for every 5 ft. moved. For instance, the GM may determine that a character moving through mud with a Speed of 30 could only move 15 ft. per Standard Move action, or that the same character moving through raging rapids could only move 10 ft. per Standard Move action.</p><p>Many groups may find it easier to track characters, movement, and ranges with figures and a battle mat. While this dramatically improves the precision of play and offers great tactile and visual benefits, it’s not for everyone and those who prefer to keep things loose should feel free to do so. These rules assume this only so far as to periodically call 5-ft. × 5-ft. areas “squares” for ease of language.</p><h2>DIAGONAL MOVEMENT (THE “5/10 RULE”)</h2><p>When using a battle mat, diagonal movement between squares covers slightly more distance than movement along an axis. For this reason, players are encouraged to use the 5/10 rule, which consumes 10 ft. of Speed for every other diagonal movement taken during the same round — that is, the second, fourth, sixth, and so on.</p><p><em>Example: </em>Brungil has a Speed of 30 ft. and takes two Standard Move actions to move as far as he can diagonally in a single round. He moves a total of 8 squares instead of 12. This rule can also be used to determine actual distance between characters or objects on a battle mat. STANCES Certain feats and other options allow a character to enter a named ‘stance.’ A character may benefit from only one stance at a time. Characters not using a stance ability are considered to be in the ‘normal stance,’ which offers no special benefits or modifiers. Entering a stance requires 1 half action and returning to normal stance is a free action. Characters who become helpless, prone, or sprawled immediately return to normal stance.</p><h1>ATTACKS</h1><p>Ultimately, every character’s goal in combat is to prevent opponents from hurting him. This typically involves putting them out of commission before they return the favor.</p><h2>LINE OF SIGHT</h2><p>A character can only attack things that are in his line of sight (i.e. things he can physically see). A target is considered to be within a character’s line of sight if it’s within the character’s visual range and no obstacles completely obscure it from the character’s view. Sometimes a character will only be able to see part of a target, in which case cover comes into play (see page 214).</p><h2>THE STANDARD ATTACK CHECK</h2><p>When a character tries to hit an opponent, he makes a “Standard Attack check.” Each attack check may represent one attack or multiple attacks made during the same amount of time (e.g. it may represent a single weapon swing or a flurry of blows granted by a feat ability).</p><p>The player rolls 1d20 and adds his appropriate attack bonus to obtain an <strong>attack check result</strong> (see page 61 for details about a character’s attack bonuses). If the result equals or exceeds the target’s Defense, the character hits and inflicts damage; otherwise, he misses.</p><h3>RANGE</h3><p>Each target is located at one of three ranges.</p><p><strong>• Melee Range (Reach):</strong> Targets within a character’s Reach are within his Melee Range. A character’s Reach is determined by his Species (see page 9). Most Medium species have a Reach of 1 square, which means that most of the time only adjacent targets are within a character’s Melee Range. Any character within an opponent’s Melee Range is considered to be “engaged in melee combat,” even if he isn’t fighting them.</p><p><strong>• Close Quarters (Beyond Reach, up to 30 ft.):</strong> Targets beyond a character’s Melee Range but within 30 ft. are within his Close Quarters Range. A ranged weapon is required to hit these targets.</p><p><strong>• Long Range (More Than 30 ft.):</strong> Targets more than 30 ft. away from a character but still within his weapon’s maximum range are within his Long Range.</p><p>When a character makes a ranged attack, his weapon or attack will have a range increment. Within this distance the character suffers no penalty with his attack check. Beyond this distance, however, he suffers a –2 penalty per full range increment between him and his target.</p><p><em>Example: </em>A long bow has a range increment of 40 ft. When the weapon is fired at a target 110 ft. away, the range modifier is –4.</p><p>A ranged weapon is only effective out to a limited number of increments. This limit is noted in the stat line as a multiplier following the range distance.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The long bow’s full range increment entry is 40 ft. × 6. It cannot be used effectively past 240 ft.</p><h3>UNTRAINED ATTACKS</h3><p>When a character makes an attack without the appropriate proficiency, the attack is “untrained.” Any character may make an untrained attack, but he suffers a –4 attack check penalty and his error range increases by 2.</p><h3>ATTACK CHECK MODIFIERS</h3><p>A number of modifiers may apply to attacks. Some are “named,” falling into one of the following categories, and others are “unnamed.” Unnamed modifiers stack but only the highest individual bonus and the highest individual penalty from each named category apply to each attack.</p><p>• <strong>Discretionary:</strong> The GM can apply a –4 to +4 modifier to represent circumstances not covered by an existing rule. For example, he might apply a +3 bonus when an attack is made from higher ground (+2) against a target on a slippery surface (+1). The GM is encouraged to use discretionary modifiers to add spice to a lagging combat.</p><p>• <strong>Dodge:</strong> Feats and actions offer these modifiers, which represent a keen ability to evade attacks. Unlike all other named modifiers, these do stack. However, when a character is flat-footed, he loses access to all dodge bonuses.</p><p>• <strong>Insight:</strong> Origins, class abilities, and feats offer these modifiers, which represent keen understanding of fighting styles.</p><p>• <strong>Gear:</strong> Gear and magic items trigger these modifiers.</p><p>• <strong>Magic:</strong> Spells and magic items impose these modifiers.</p><p>• <strong>Morale:</strong> Class abilities offer most morale modifiers, which showcase confidence in battle.</p><p>• <strong>Size:</strong> A character’s Size affects Defense as shown on Table 5.4: Size (see page 217).</p><h3>FREE ATTACKS</h3><p>A character may occasionally gain 1 or more “free attacks,” which are single attacks that cannot trigger other attacks. Each free attack is a free-action Standard Attack and may be boosted with tricks and other rules. However, a free attack may never grant more than 1 attack, even when a character option would otherwise trigger multiple attacks.</p><h2>DEFENSE</h2><p>A character’s Defense is equal to 10 + the sum of his class Defense bonuses + his Dexterity modifier. An object’s Defense is equal to 5 + its Size modifier (if stationary), 10 + its Size modifier (if moving), or its holder’s total Defense bonus + its Size modifier (if carried). The Defense of a 5 ft. area (1 square) is 15, whether it’s occupied or not.</p><h2>THE DAMAGE ROLL</h2><p>When an attack hits, the weapon used determines the damage inflicted.</p><p><strong>No Weapon (Unarmed Attack):</strong> If the attacker has the Unarmed proficiency, he inflicts 1d4 lethal damage; otherwise, he inflicts 1d3 subdual damage. In both cases, he applies his Strength modifier.</p><p><strong>Weapon:</strong> The character inflicts the weapon’s base damage (see page 176). With a melee attack or a non-explosive hurled attack, he applies his Strength modifier.</p><p>Character options, actions, and other effects may modify an attack’s damage, which may only drop to 0 due to Damage Reduction or Damage Resistance (see page 208 and 209).</p><p>Occasionally, bonuses or multipliers may apply to a character’s damage. When 1 or more bonuses and multipliers apply to the same damage total, flat bonuses are applied before multipliers while variable bonuses — i.e. all rolled bonuses — are applied after.</p><p><em>Example: </em>Brungil hits with an attack that inflicts 1d6 lethal damage. He benefits from a +2 bonus to damage as well as 1 die of sneak attack damage and a ×2 multiplier. He rolls a 4 with his lethal damage die and a 3 with his sneak attack damage die, so his total damage is 15: ((4 + 2) ×2) + 3.</p><h2>INJURY AND DEATH</h2><p>Fantasy Craft features two types of combatants: <strong>standard</strong> and <strong>special</strong>. Standard characters are easy to kill and generally have fewer statistics because they’ll often appear in large numbers for the fun of it, while special characters are important to the plot and represent significant danger to the opposition. Player characters are examples of special characters, as are villains. Monsters and NPCs can be either standard or special, as determined by the GM. More information is available in Chapter 6 (see page 224).</p><p>Special characters have <strong>vitality points</strong> and <strong>wound points</strong>, which together measure their ability to remain standing in a fight. Individually, however, these points represent very different things.</p><p><strong>• Vitality Points:</strong> These are a mixture of endurance, luck, and the will to fight, measuring a character’s ability to avoid injury. Losing vitality does not represent actual physical damage but rather combat fatigue, as it gradually becomes more difficult for the character to avoid being hurt. As a character’s vitality drops, he edges closer to exhaustion and the possibility of a nasty wound.</p><p><strong>• Wound Points:</strong> These are a direct measure of a character’s remaining vigor, measuring his ability to sustain injury. As a character’s wounds drop, he acquires abrasions, cuts, and eventually broken bones and worse.</p><p>These points simulate the flow of an adventure epic, in which the heroes dive through endless ranks of the enemy before they suffer a single serious hit in a critical battle.</p><p>For ease of tracking, standard characters don’t have vitality and wounds; rather, they have Damage saves, which are used to determine the immediate effects of each hit. Much of the time, standard characters drop out of the fight after failing a single Damage save.</p><h3>SPECIAL CHARACTER DAMAGE</h3><p>When a special character suffers damage, it usually reduces his vitality. He suffers no ill effects from damage until his vitality drops to 0, at which point he becomes fatigued and any remaining damage reduces his wounds (a character’s vitality cannot drop below 0). When a character’s wounds reach 0, the character falls unconscious and if there is damage remaining it continues to reduce his wounds below 0. A character dies at –10 wounds and his body is destroyed at –25 wounds.</p><p>While a special character’s wounds are negative, he’s dying and his wounds continue to drop even if he’s not attacked. At the start of his Initiative Count during each round, he rolls d%. If the result is equal to or less than his Constitution score, he stabilizes and his wounds return to 0; otherwise, his wounds drop by 1. A dying character may also be stabilized with a successful full action Medicine/Stabilize check (DC 15).</p><h3>STANDARD CHARACTER DAMAGE</h3><p>When a standard character suffers damage from any source (or of any type, including stress or subdual), it adds to a single damage total the character’s suffered during the current scene. The GM rolls 1d20 and adds the character’s Damage save bonus. If the result is equal to or higher than 10 + 1/2 the accumulated damage (rounded down), the character suffers nicks and scratches but no lasting injury; otherwise, he either falls unconscious (if the damage is subdual or stress), or dies (otherwise).</p><p>Some standard characters must fail more than 1 Damage save before they’re out of the fight, such as those with the tough quality (see page 235). Each time one of these characters fails a Damage save, his accumulated damage resets to 0.</p><h2>SPECIAL ATTACK RESULTS</h2><p>Every attack has an error range and a threat range, which are natural die results that trigger special attack results. Unless otherwise specified, an attack has an error range of 1 and a threat range of 20, though character options, weapon choices, and other effects may modify these base values. Bonuses expand the range of natural die rolls that trigger an error or threat, and penalties scale them back. Modifiers may not eliminate error and threat ranges.</p><p><em>Example: </em>A character’s error range increases by 2 and his threat range increases by 1. Unless other modifiers are in play, his attacks have an error range of 1–3 and a threat range of 19–20.</p><h3>THREATS AND CRITICAL HITS</h3><p>When a character hits with an attack and rolls a natural number within his threat range (an actual roll of the number on a d20), he scores a threat — a potential critical hit. To gain the benefits of a critical hit, the character simply spends 1 or more action dice (when an attack hits multiple characters, the attacker chooses which to critically hit, spending 1 or more dice for each). This cost is paid separately for each hit, even when multiple hits are scored with a single attack or action.</p><p>A critical hit has the following effects.</p><p><strong>Special Character:</strong> The attacker may spend 1 action die to apply the damage directly to the target’s wounds, ignoring any remaining vitality. Alternately, if the damage exceeds the target’s Constitution score, the attacker may spend 2 action dice to inflict a critical injury, as shown on Table 5.1: The Table of Ouch (see below).</p><p><strong>Standard Character or Object:</strong> The attacker may spend 1 to 4 action dice to cause the target to automatically fail the same number of Damage saves. In the case of most standard targets, 1 action die is enough to knock them out of the fight (see Injury and Death, page 206).</p><p>The GM and players are encouraged to come up with interesting descriptions for critical hits, such as dramatic flourishes, cool maneuvers, and impressive strategic ploys. Critical hits are an excellent way to turn any otherwise mundane combat into something extraordinary.</p><p><strong>Special Note:</strong> A threat scored by a standard NPC may only become a critical hit if the NPC has the treacherous quality</p><h3>ERRORS AND CRITICAL MISSES</h3><p>When a character misses with an attack and rolls a natural number within his error range (an actual roll of the number on a d20), or produces a negative attack check result, he suffers an error — a potential critical miss. He only suffers the effects of the critical miss, however, if his opponent — commonly the GM — spends 1 or more action dice.</p><p>The GM determines the effects of any critical miss, based on the number of action dice spent (though he can certainly poll the defender or even the other players for ideas). Most critical misses should have a descriptive and mechanical component, and they should be challenging and entertaining rather than debilitating. The goal is not to punish the attacker but rather to insert some new obstacles and interesting elements into the fight. Depriving the party of the one weapon it needs to defeat an enemy is bad form, as is destroying an item the party worked hard to craft or obtain. Having an arrow fly wildly off course to attract more monsters is an excellent option, however, as is wedging a sword in a stone pillar, forcing an Athletics check to wrench it free. If all else fails and nothing comes to mind, simply apply 1d6 stress or subdual damage per action die spent and call it heat-of-battle tension or incidental battle bruising.</p><p><strong>1 Action Die:</strong> In a fight to save a colony of friendly pixies from several undead rootwalkers, Brungil accidentally smacks the pixie leader with the broad side of his axe. The pixie will be fine, but he’s out of the fight for 1 round.</p><p><strong>2 Action Dice:</strong> In the same fight, Brungil swings too powerfully and loses grip, flinging his axe into one of the rootwalker’s branches. He’ll have to make a half action Jump or Climb check with a DC of 15 to get it back. (If the GM had spent 3 action dice, the rootwalker could use the weapon to attack Brungil until it’s retrieved.)</p><p><strong>3 Action Dice:</strong> Continuing the example, Brungil overextends himself and drives his axe into the forest earth — which opens up to swallow him! Half the rootwalkers drive their feet through the earth to thrust at him as he tries to climb free, making the Climb check a full round action with a –2 discretionary penalty. The other half can use the same method to attack Brungil but he can’t return the favor until he’s out of the pit.</p><p><strong>4 Action Dice:</strong> In a moment of supreme misadventure Brungil’s axe... slices through one of the rootwalkers, eliciting a sorrowful moan as brackish sap erupts through the wound. Brungil is covered in the stuff but suffers no other immediate effects. As he’ll soon find out, however, he can wash the sap off but the stain remains... and inflicts a –2 morale penalty with all Impress and Haggle checks until Brungil finds and dispatches the dark wizard who created the vile rootwalker army.</p><h1>ADVANCED DAMAGE</h1><p>Now that the basics are out of the way, here are a few advanced damage rules.</p><h2>CRITICAL INJURIES</h2><p>One of the most effective ways to leave a lasting impression in a fight is to leave the opponent with a little something to remember you by. Critical injuries offer an opportunity for characters to scar, break, and maim the enemy, brutally establishing their battle superiority. Using them is simple. Each time a character suffers 25 or more points of damage in a single hit, he makes a Fortitude save (DC 1/2 the damage suffered, rounded down). With failure, he rolls 1d20 and adds the damage suffered, consulting Table 5.1: The Table of Ouch to find his critical injury (see page 207).</p><p>Except for the bleeding condition, which heals naturally at the end of the current scene, each critical injury lingers for 1d4 months. This time may be reduced with a successful Treatment check (see page 78).</p><p>The GM and players are encouraged to keep track of critical injuries and factor them into subsequent adventures. NPCs might ask about nasty scars and enemies might comment on suspicious limps in the area of wounds they’ve inflicted, among other scenarios.</p><h4>Table 5.1: Table of Ouch</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left;width:80px\">Result</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Critical Injury</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Up to 35</td><td>Bleeding</td></tr><tr><td>36–40</td><td>Battered limb (1d6: 1–3: –2 with actions taken using the arm, 4–6: Speed reduced by 10 ft.)</td></tr><tr><td>41–45</td><td>Bruised ego (all healing times doubled)</td></tr><tr><td>46–50</td><td>Head trauma (1d6: 1–3: visual range 1/2 normal (rounded down), 4–6: hearing range 1/2 normal (rounded down))</td></tr><tr><td>51–55</td><td>Broken limb (1d6: 1–3: lose use of arm, 4–6: Speed reduced by 20 ft.)</td></tr><tr><td>56–60</td><td>Internal rupture (–3 to highest of Str, Dex, or Con)</td></tr><tr><td>61–65</td><td>Brain trauma (–3 to highest of Int, Wis, or Cha)</td></tr><tr><td>66+</td><td>Grave wound (once per hour, Fort save (DC 15) or lose 1 Con; Downtime Medicine check (DC 40) to repair)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>MASSIVE DAMAGE</h2><p>When a character suffers 50 or more points of damage in a single hit, he makes a Fortitude save (DC 1/2 the damage suffered, rounded down). With failure, he dies instantly.</p><h2>DAMAGE REDUCTION</h2><p>Gear, abilities, animal and monster hides, and other effects grant Damage Reduction (DR), which allows a target to ignore some or all damage from each hit. When a target with 1 or more points of Damage Reduction suffers damage, the Damage Reduction is subtracted from the damage before it’s applied. If this reduces the damage to 0 or lower, any special effects inflicted by the attack are negated as well.</p><p><em>Example: </em>Brungil is hit with a poisoned knife but his armor’s Damage Reduction reduces the attack’s damage to 0. Brungil takes no damage and is not affected by the poison. Damage Reduction is sometimes abbreviated as “DR” and weaknesses sometimes follow the full value in parentheses.</p><p><em>Example: </em>A special piece of armor might offer “DR 4/blunt,” which means that it offers 4 points of Damage Reduction against everything except blunt weapons.</p><p>Finally, when damage possesses the armor-piercing quality, the target’s DR decreases against the damage by the number listed after the quality (see page 176).</p><h2>DAMAGE RESISTANCE</h2><p>Another protection against damage is Damage Resistance, which differs from Damage Reduction in that it affects only one source of damage (see next). Damage Resistance is defined by the GM and may offer protection from virtually anything. Common Resistances include cold (offered by warm clothing), blunt, edged, and other weapons (offered by armor), and various damage types (offered by spells).</p><p>Damage Resistance is listed as a source of damage followed by a number (e.g. ‘acid 5’, which means “5 points of Damage Resistance against acid damage,” or “cold 2,” which means “2 points of Damage Resistance against damage inflicted by cold”). When a target with 1 or more points of Damage Resistance suffers damage of the listed type or from the listed source, the Resistance is subtracted from the damage before it’s applied. As with Damage Reduction, if this reduces the damage to 0 or lower, any special effects inflicted by the attack are negated as well.</p><p>When Damage Resistance and Damage Reduction both apply to the same damage, Damage Reduction is applied first.</p><h2>DAMAGE TYPES</h2><p>Adventuring is a wild and untamed profession, bringing characters in contact with many awful situations, not all of which simply harm. Some have other effects, which are handled with damage types. Lethal and subdual are the most common damage types but there are many others.</p><p>Each attack or injury may inflict only one type of damage. When more than one damage type applies to an attack (e.g. a flaming sword, which can inflict for either lethal or fire damage), the attacker decides which to apply. Sneak attack damage is the one exception to this rule, as it’s a special damage type that augments another.</p><p><strong>Damage Conversion:</strong> A special case applies when an attack inflicts subdual or lethal damage. In this case, the attacker may choose to convert the damage from one of these types to the other. This decision must be made before the attack roll is made, as a –4 penalty is applied to the check. The resulting damage is converted to the chosen type and reduced to 1/2 normal (rounded up).</p><p><strong>Object Damage:</strong> Some damage types, such as acid, also damage a character’s gear or surroundings. The GM might want to do the same with other damage types, though the option is best reserved for special situations where it might have an impact on the current adventure or the character’s personal saga.</p><h3>ACID DAMAGE</h3><p>• When an unarmored character suffers acid damage, he suffers the full damage when hit and at the start of his Initiative Count during the following round he suffers 1/2 as much (rounded down). The damage continues to be reduced and applied in this fashion until it reaches 0.</p><p>• When an armored character suffers acid damage, compare the acid damage to the armor’s DR. If the acid damage is higher, both the character and the armor suffer damage as described above; otherwise, the armor suffers the damage until it fails a single Damage save, at which point both the character and the armor suffer any remaining damage.</p><p>• Acid damage can quickly destroy armor. Armor that fails 1 Damage save against acid damage is broken and armor that fails 2 saves is destroyed.</p><h3>BANG DAMAGE</h3><p>• Bang damage does not affect objects or characters who are deafened.</p><p>• Bang damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• Bang damage tapers off (see Blast, page 214).</p><p>• Bang damage is not applied to the target’s vitality and wounds and cannot prompt Damage saves or inflict critical injuries; rather, it becomes a Fortitude save DC for all characters in range. Any character who fails this save becomes stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds.</p><h3>COLD DAMAGE</h3><p>• Cold damage immediately becomes subdual damage and also has the following effects.</p><p>• Cold damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• When cold damage is inflicted by an extreme environment (i.e. a blizzard), an exposed character makes a Survival check (DC 20). With success, he suffers 1d6 subdual damage every four hours; otherwise, he suffers 1d6 subdual damage every hour.</p><h3>DIVINE DAMAGE</h3><p>• Divine damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• When a character suffers divine damage he must also make a Will save (DC equal to the damage inflicted) or become baffled for 1d6 rounds.</p><h3>ELECTRICAL DAMAGE</h3><p>• Electrical damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• When a character suffers electrical damage he must also make a Fortitude save (DC equal to the damage inflicted) or become sickened for 1d6 rounds.</p><h3>EXPLOSIVE DAMAGE</h3><p>• Explosive damage tapers off (see Blast, page 214).</p><p>• Each character within range of explosive damage may make a Reflex save (DC equal to the damage inflicted). With success, he suffers only 1/2 the damage (rounded down, minimum 1).</p><p>• Each character who suffers more than 20 points of explosive damage from a single attack becomes sprawled.</p><h3>FIRE DAMAGE</h3><p>• When a character suffers fire damage, he must also make a Reflex save (DC equal to the damage) or catch fire. While burning, a character suffers the fire’s full damage at the start of his Initiative Count each round. Further, he must make a Will save (DC equal to the damage) or immediately run as far out of the fire as possible, drop prone, and begin rolling to put himself out. While rolling, a character’s fire damage drops by 10 per round until the fire is out.</p><p>• Each round that a character or object remains on fire, the GM rolls 1d20 and with a result equal to or lower than the damage the fire spreads to the immediate scenery. Unless put out, a scenery fire spreads 5 ft. in a random direction every round, per the Deviation Diagram (see page 216).</p><p>• Until put out, any fire — whether on a character or scenery — worsens by 1d6 damage per round.</p><p>• Putting out a fire by any means — water, blankets, etc. — decreases a fire’s damage by 10 points per round.</p><h3>FLASH DAMAGE</h3><p>• Flash damage does not affect objects or characters who are blinded.</p><p>• Flash damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• Flash damage tapers off (see Blast, page 214).</p><p>• Flash damage is not applied to the target’s vitality and wounds and cannot prompt Damage saves or inflict critical injuries; rather, it becomes a Fortitude save DC for all characters in range. Any character who fails this save becomes blinded for 1d6 rounds.</p><h3>FORCE DAMAGE</h3><p>• Force damage affects incorporeal targets (see page 213).</p><h3>HEAT DAMAGE</h3><p>• Heat damage immediately becomes subdual damage and also has the following effects.</p><p>• Heat damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• When heat damage is inflicted by an extreme environment (i.e. a heat wave), an exposed character makes a Survival check (DC 20). With success, he suffers 1d6 subdual damage every four hours; otherwise, he suffers 1d6 subdual damage every hour.</p><h3>SNEAK ATTACK DAMAGE</h3><p>• When a character possesses 1 or more dice of sneak attack damage, he may use them to augment the damage of any Standard Attack or Coup de Grace made against a flatfooted, flanked, or helpless target.</p><p>• Sneak attack damage only affects characters who can suffer critical hits, who are not hidden from the attacker, and whose vitals are within reach.</p><p>• If a single attack generates multiple hits, sneak attack damage is only applied to the first hit.</p><h3>SONIC DAMAGE</h3><p>• Sonic damage affects all targets, even deafened characters, as its vibrations can literally shred skin and organs.</p><p>• Sonic damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• Sonic damage tapers off (see Blast, page 214).</p><p>• When a character suffers sonic damage he must also make a Fortitude save (DC equal to the damage inflicted) or become deafened for 1d6 rounds.</p><h3>STRESS DAMAGE</h3><p>• Stress damage doesn’t affect objects.</p><p>• Stress damage ignores Damage Reduction.</p><p>• For ease of use and because stress damage should be as ubiquitous as the GM wants, stress damage is included in very few places in these rules. Rather, the GM may apply stress damage anytime a character suffers any other damage, or at any point when he feels a character is sufficiently unnerved. When applying stress damage on top of other damage, the GM simply decides whether to apply 1/2 as much stress damage (rounded down), or an equal amount (stress damage is encouraged when a character suffers acid or fire damage, for instance, likely equal to the acid or fire damage suffered). When no other damage is present, the GM simply chooses a single die of any type, as appropriate to the situation, and rolls. The result is the stress damage suffered (d12s and d20s should be reserved for only the most soul-crushing experiences).</p><p>• Stress damage is not applied to the target’s vitality and wounds and cannot inflict critical injuries; rather, it accumulates over time until it wears off.</p><p>• Each time a special character suffers stress damage, he must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 his total stress damage, rounded down). With failure, he becomes shaken and his total stress damage resets to 0. If he’s already shaken, the condition worsens by 1 grade (see page 213). With a critical hit, the character is also stunned for 1 round (if the Will save succeeds), or stunned for 1d6 rounds (otherwise).</p><p>• Outside combat or once all sources of anguish are removed, stress damage wears off at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes.</p><p><em>Example: </em>During a fierce border skirmish between two rival nations, Brungil witnesses a close friend skewered in a hail of arrows. The GM determines this is harrowing enough to justify a d8 of stress damage and rolls, inflicting 4 points. Brungil must make a Will save (DC 12) and scores a result of 15. He manages to press on. Minutes later, enemy reinforcements arrive with a dragon in their ranks and Brungil charges forth, unsure of anything but the fact that the wyrm must fall. Before he even reaches the foot of the beast it unleashes a hellish blast of flame across the friendly troops, reducing many to ash and setting Brungil alight. The GM rules that Brungil suffers as much stress damage as the attack, which inflicts an incredible 22 points of fire damage. Now at 26 points of stress damage, Brungil must make a Will save with a DC of 23 or become shaken. If the dragon’s attack is a critical hit, Brungil is also stunned for 1 round, or 1d6 rounds if he fails his Will save.</p><h3>SUBDUAL DAMAGE</h3><p>• Subdual damage doesn’t affect objects.</p><p>• Subdual damage is not applied to the target’s vitality and wounds and cannot inflict critical injuries; rather, it accumulates over time until it wears off.</p><p>• Each time a special character suffers subdual damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 his total subdual damage, rounded down). With failure, he becomes fatigued and his total subdual damage resets to 0. If he’s already fatigued, the condition worsens by 1 grade (see page 213). With a critical hit, the character is also stunned for 1 round (if the Fortitude save succeeds), or stunned for 1d6 rounds (otherwise).</p><p>• Subdual damage can eventually kill. When an unconscious character suffers subdual damage, the character instead suffers the same amount of lethal damage.</p><p>• Outside combat or once all sources of physical strain are removed, subdual damage wears off at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes.</p><p><em>Example: </em>An orc pummels Brungil, inflicting 18 points of subdual damage and forcing him to make a Fortitude save (DC 19). He succeeds with a result of 21. A couple rounds later he’s hit for an additional 4 points of subdual damage and has to make another Fortitude save (DC 21). This time he fails with a result of 18. He becomes fatigued and his accumulated subdual damage resets to 0. The very next round the orc performs a Tire action on Brungil, inflicting 5 points of subdual damage. Poor Brungil’s save result is only 8 — he needed at least a 12 — and so his fatigued condition worsens to fatigued II. His accumulated subdual damage resets to 0 again, but if he fails three more saves he’s down for the count.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"HEALING AND CONDITIONS","type":"text","_id":"4a8CkchFrUBF4E4w","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>HEALING</h1><p>After a good beating, the party limps back to town hoping to recuperate.

On a disturbingly regular basis they’re tested mentally, physically, and spiritually, and the consequences of these assaults are many and varied. Conditions are a way of easily categorizing large numbers of lingering effects that might plague characters.</p><p>Conditions are temporary. Sometimes their durations are defined by the rules that inflict them; other times their durations are fixed in the condition text. Regardless of their stated durations, however, all conditions fade at the end of each adventure.</p><p>Some conditions are graded, featuring Roman Numerals (e.g. “I–III”). When a character suffers a graded condition he already has, the condition’s grade increases by 1. In all other cases, suffering a condition twice at the same time has no effect.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, the effects of all conditions stack.</p><p><strong>Baffled (I–V):</strong> The character suffers a –2 penalty with all skill checks per grade he suffers. A character loses 1 baffled grade at the end of each scene.</p><p><strong>Bleeding:</strong> The character suffers 1 point of subdual damage at the end of each round. If he takes 1 or more actions during the round, he suffers 1d4 lethal damage instead. This condition heals at the end of the current scene, but may be eliminated earlier with a successful full-round Medicine check (DC 20).</p><p><strong>Blinded:</strong> The character is flat-footed and cannot see anything. He cannot make skill checks that require sight and suffers a –8 penalty with attack checks. Meanwhile, his opponents gain a +2 bonus when attacking him.</p><p><strong>Deafened:</strong> The character cannot hear anything and cannot make skill checks that require hearing.</p><p><strong>Enraged:</strong> The character may not make skill checks and automatically attacks the nearest conscious opponent with his most damaging attack. If no opponent is close enough to attack during the current round, the character turns on the nearest target, even if it’s a friend. Once per round, the character may make a Resolve check (DC 20) to calm himself and lose this condition; otherwise it fades at the end of the current scene. In either case, the character falls unconscious immediately after.</p><p><strong>Entangled:</strong> The character suffers a –2 penalty with attack checks and a –4 penalty with Dexterity-based skill checks. He may not Refresh or Run, and his Speed drops to 1/2 standard (rounded down).</p><p><strong>Fatigued (I–IV + special):</strong> The character may not Run. Further, his Speed drops by 5 ft., his Strength score drops by 2, and his Dexterity score drops by 2 per grade he suffers (e.g. at fatigued II, a character’s Speed drops by 10 ft. and his Strength and Dexterity scores drop by 4 each). If a character with fatigued IV is fatigued again, he instead falls unconscious. A character loses 1 fatigued grade at the end of each scene and for each full hour of sleep.</p><p><strong>Fixated:</strong> The character may not attack or make skill checks and must take at least 1 Standard Move action per round toward the source of his fixation. Once per round, the character may make a Resolve check (DC 20) to regain composure and lose this condition; otherwise it fades at the end of the current scene. This condition is also lost if the character is attacked by an adversary.</p><p><strong>Flanked:</strong> A character is flanked when 2 opponents stand on directly opposite and adjacent sides of him. While flanking a character, an opponent gains a +2 bonus with attack checks against him.</p><p><strong>Flat-Footed:</strong> The character loses his Dexterity bonus to Defense (if positive), as well as all dodge bonuses to Defense. He may also be targeted with a variety of special effects, such as sneak attack damage. The flat-footed condition is lost when the character takes a half or full action, or is successfully attacked.</p><p><strong>Frightened:</strong> The character may not attack or make skill checks and must take at least 1 Standard Move action per round away from the source of his fear. Once per round, the character may make a Resolve check (DC 20) to regain composure and lose this condition; otherwise it fades at the end of the current scene.</p><p><strong>Held:</strong> The character is flat-footed and may take no non-free actions except an opposed Athletics check to escape the hold. A character who becomes held a second time loses this condition and becomes pinned.</p><p><strong>Helpless:</strong> A character is helpless when he is unable to defend himself in any way. Attacks against a helpless character gain a +4 bonus. Also, the character may be targeted with a Coup de Grace action (see page 219).</p><p><strong>Hidden:</strong> A character is hidden from those who don’t know his location. They may not attack him, nor may they target him with skill checks that require line of sight. When a hidden character attacks an oblivious target within Close Quarters, the target is considered flat-footed (even if he isn’t otherwise).</p><p>Any character aware of a hidden character’s presence may make an opposed full-round Search check vs. the hidden character’s Blend or Sneak (GM’s choice) and with success the target character loses the hidden condition. A character also loses this condition whenever he casts a spell, makes an attack, or takes any obvious action.</p><p><strong>Incorporeal:</strong> The character cannot be harmed with physical attacks but is affected by force damage and other non-physical attacks as normal. He may pass through solid objects at will, though force fields and other effects block his movement. This condition doesn’t convey any special ability to float or fly, and an incorporeal character must hold his breath when his mouth and nose are blocked. Should a character lose this condition while occupying the same space as another character or object, they merge and all characters in the merged mass are immediately killed.</p><p><strong>Invisible:</strong> When the character moves at least 10 ft. from his starting position as his last action during a round, he becomes hidden.</p><p><strong>Paralyzed:</strong> The character is flat-footed and may only take actions that are purely mental.</p><p><strong>Pinned:</strong> The character is flat-footed and may take no actions except an opposed Athletics check to escape the pin (in which case the character becomes held instead). He may be bound with 1 free action and may only speak as the pinning character allows. The pinning character may use him as a human shield, gaining 1/2 personal cover. Finally, each adjacent opponent gains a +4 bonus with attacks targeting the character.</p><p><strong>Prone:</strong> A character is prone when he’s intentionally lying on the ground. He may not take Movement actions other than Handle Item and Reposition, though he still gains his Bonus 5-ft. Step if he doesn’t take a Movement action. The character gains a +2 bonus to Defense against ranged attacks, but also suffers a –2 penalty with melee attacks.</p><p><strong>Shaken (I–IV + special):</strong> The character may not take 10 or 20. Further, he suffers a –2 penalty with all attack checks, as well as Charisma- and Wisdom-based skill checks, per grade suffered. If a character with shaken IV is shaken again, he instead falls unconscious. A character loses 1 shaken grade at the end of each scene.</p><p><strong>Sickened:</strong> The character suffers a –2 penalty with all attacks and skill checks, as well as all damage rolls and saves. </p><p><strong>Slowed:</strong> The character may take only 1 half action during each round. Further, he suffers a –1 penalty with attack checks and Reflex saves, his Defense decreases by 1, and his Speed drops to 1/2 standard (rounded down).</p><p><strong>Sprawled:</strong> A character is sprawled when he’s knocked off his feet. He is flat-footed and suffers a –2 penalty with all attack checks. This condition is lost when the character Repositions (see page 220).</p><p><strong>Stunned:</strong> The character is flat-footed and may take no actions.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"SPECIAL COMBAT RULES","type":"text","_id":"cHKpeinCoo4lnTeb","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The following sections cover all the various parts of the combat equation that don’t fit well among the basic rules, compartmentalized for easy reference and use.</p><h1>BLAST</h1><p>Some attacks affect everything within an area, their damage tapering off over distance. This effect is called “blast.” Every blast attack has a base area of effect — a <strong>blast increment</strong> — that’s measured in 5-ft. squares, and a center square called <strong>Ground Zero</strong>, which is the square where the blast attack lands or from which it erupts (e.g. a bomb’s point of impact). Everything and everyone at Ground Zero suffers the blast’s full damage. This damage drops by 1/2 (rounded down) within each blast increment out from Ground Zero, until the damage drops below 1 point, at which point it tapers off entirely.</p><p>Blast can also take the shape of a cone. The damage still tapers off over distance, though only in one direction.</p><p>For examples of circular and conical blast, see below.</p><img src=\"worlds/degora/assets/pages/rdjsK3PbUeETn0fH-pages-cHKpeinCoo4lnTeb-image-oZ9qLAFALRc8VEb0.png\" /><p>Black squares are Ground Zero. Cone effects are illustrated by areas blocked out with hard black lines and the circled squares behind Ground Zero are the locations of casters when these cone effects are spells.</p><h1>COVER</h1><p>When a character’s line of sight to a target is partially blocked, that target benefits from cover. All cover is rated in quarters (1/4 cover, 1/2 cover, 3/4 cover, and total cover) and offers a bonus to the target’s Defense from attacks from beyond the cover, as well as Reflex saves made to avoid attacks and damage from beyond the cover, as shown on Table 5.2: Cover (see page 215).</p><p>At any time, a character may only benefit from the best each of two types of cover: <strong>personal cover</strong> (cover available in his square or gained from gear or character options) and <strong>scenery cover</strong> (cover available from intervening obstacles). These cover values are added together to determine the character’s actual cover from attacks and damage.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Brungil squats behind the ruins of a fortress wall (1/4 cover) at the other side of several large trees from an attacker (1/2 cover). He benefits from 3/4 cover against that attacker.</p><h4>Table 5.2: Cover</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:120px\">Cover</th><th>Examples</th><th style=\"width:100px\">Defense Bonus</th><th style=\"width:90px\">Reflex Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">One-quarter (1/4)</td><td>Short wall that protects up to knees</td><td>+2</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">One-half (1/2)</td><td>Corner that protects all but half of the torso and head; window that reveals down to waist</td><td>+4</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Three-quarters (3/4)</td><td>Corner or narrow opening that protects all but part of the head</td><td>+6</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Total</td><td>Solid wall that protects entire body</td><td>Attack impossible</td><td>+4</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>DEVIATION</h1><p>When a character misses with an attack or weapon that is subject to deviation (such as a thrown vial of acid), the shot deviates a random number of 5-ft. squares from the target. The die rolled to determine this distance is based on the number of range increments between the character and his target, as shown on Table 5.3: Deviation (see page 216). To determine the direction of deviation, roll 1d8 and consult the Deviation Diagram (see page 216).</p><p>If this deviation causes the shot to hit something else, damage is applied as standard.</p><h4>Table 5.3: DEVIATION</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Range Increments to Target</th><th>1-2</th><th>3-4</th><th>5-6</th><th>7-8</th><th>9-10</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Deviation Distance</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d8</td></tr></tbody></table><img src=\"worlds/degora/assets/pages/rdjsK3PbUeETn0fH-pages-cHKpeinCoo4lnTeb-image-mnQofoIzGHeBWv8y.png\" /><h2>FALLING</h2><p>Normally, a character suffers 1d6 lethal damage per 10 ft. fallen (max. 20d6) and automatically becomes sprawled when he lands. However, a falling character may make an Acrobatics check (DC 20), and with success he suffers only 1/2 the damage (rounded down, minimum 1 per 10 ft. fallen).</p><p>Damage Reduction has no effect on falling damage.</p><h2>MOUNTED CHARACTERS</h2><p>The development of cavalry is one of the greatest innovations in the history of warfare. The combined strength and speed of a trained mount with the cunning and weaponry of an experienced rider is a powerful asset on any battlefield, able to casually sweep aside many other combatants. Mounted warfare is similarly devastating in Fantasy Craft and in some ways more so, given the possibilities to be had with griffons, drakes, and more!</p><p>During combat, a rider and his mount are treated as a single “mounted character.” This character’s Size is equal to the larger of the pair (usually the mount) and it benefits from all the mount’s movement options and Speed values. It uses the lower of the pair’s Defense, Initiative, and Saving Throw bonuses but the higher of the pair’s Damage Reduction and Resistances. The mounted character’s attack and skill bonuses are determined by the half of the pair that performs each action. When it isn’t clear whether to use the rider or mount’s stats, use those of the mount.</p><p>A mounted character may take 1 full action or 2 half actions per round — the mount and rider do not act separately or gain additional actions. The mounted character can use these actions to do anything either of the pair can. If only one of the pair is a special character that character makes all decisions, but if both are standard or special characters they must agree on actions taken. When an equal pair can’t decide in a reasonable amount of time, they revert to separate characters (one a passenger on the other).</p><p>A mounted character’s ability to withstand damage is likewise not combined — damage is applied separately to each half of the pair. By default when a mounted character is hit, the rider chooses whether the damage is applied to him or the mount, though the attacker can spend 2 action dice to make the choice instead.</p><p>A mounted character suffers a −2 penalty with melee and unarmed attacks, and a −4 penalty with Spellcasting and ranged attacks.</p><p>Finally, when fighting a mounted character, an attacker can use a special variant of the Trip action (see page 221). With success, the attacker upsets the mount, which throws the rider. Both characters become sprawled and the rider is moved to any unoccupied 5-ft. area adjacent to the mount (his choice). This effect replaces the Trip action’s standard benefit. Keep in mind that Trip actions are modified by the relative Size between attacker and target, and that a mounted pair is often the bigger of the two.</p><p>Most of these rules also apply when a character uses a vehicle, such as a chariot (see page 169).</p><h1>ONE- AND TWO-HANDED WEAPONS</h1><p>In Fantasy Craft, all weapons are either 1-handed or 2-handed. A character may hold one 1-handed weapon in each hand, but this does not grant him any additional attacks. Each time he may make an attack, he may use the weapon in either hand.</p><p>A character of Medium or larger Size may use a 2-handed weapon with one hand, but suffers a –4 penalty with his attack check. Conversely, a character may hold a 1-handed weapon with both hands, in which case his Strength score increases by 2 when determining damage.</p><p>A character may only wield weapons of his Size or smaller. Weapons may be scaled up or down in Size with the large-scale and small-scale upgrades (see page 184).</p><h1>POISON AND DISEASE</h1><p>Little compares to the horror of a lurking killer you can’t see or fight, stealing your life by the minute. It’s every adventurer’s worst nightmare: that his body might turn against him, stealing glory to leaving him an enfeebled, withering husk. Poisons and disease can change worlds, killing kings and toppling nations, but they’re also some of the most dangerous tools in the GM’s adventure toolbox. Most players resent helplessness and outside the hunt for an antidote there isn’t much a party can do to combat the spread. Game Masters are advised to keep deadly and disabling contagions in the background most of the time, using them primarily as flavor. When specific effects must be determined, however, here are the rules.</p><p>Poisons and diseases can be inhaled, ingested, absorbed through the skin, or applied to weapons. Each has an Incubation Period, during which time it spreads through a character’s system. Thereafter, and at the end of each subsequent Incubation Period, he makes a Fortitude save (DC 12). With success, he fights the contagion off entirely; otherwise, he suffers the listed effects. This process continues until the character fights off the contagion or dies. Antidotes are specific to each contagion and spread through the system over a period of time equal to the Incubation Period (during which the character may still have to make another Fortitude save).</p><p>Fantasy Craft details common poisons in Chapter 4 (see page 165), and common diseases in Chapter 7 (see page 341).</p><h1>SAVING THROWS</h1><p>Most of the time when a character resists an effect, he makes a “saving throw,” or “save.” There are three types of saves, each with its own bonus and uses (see page 61).</p><p>Saves are made as directed by the GM or the rules. When a rule calls for a save, the DC and other pertinent information is provided. When the GM calls for a save, he determines the DC based on the relevant rules or the difficulty of resisting the effect, with 15 representing a routine save and 40 representing a nearly impossible one.</p><p>The player rolls 1d20 and adds his appropriate save bonus to obtain a saving throw result. If this equals or exceeds the DC, the character resists; otherwise, he suffers the full effect. In most cases, a successful save either negates the effect or reduces it to 1/2 standard, though many other results are possible, as noted in each save description or directed by the GM.</p><p>All Reflex saving throws are subject to Defense Penalties from armor (see page 173).</p><h1>SIZE</h1><p>The physical profiles of characters, scenery, animals, and objects vary widely but everything in the universe — including weapons — uses the same Size scale, as shown on Table 5.4: Size (see page 217). Size has a couple mechanical effects, as follows.</p><p><strong>Defense:</strong> This modifier is applied to the Defense of characters and objects. It may not reduce Defense below 1.</p><p><strong>Footprint:</strong> This is the space a character or object takes up, presented as a range in 5-ft. × 5-ft. squares. A character or object’s Footprint determines the maximum number of characters that can attack (no more than one per adjacent square). Creatures and objects of Large or bigger Size likely have unique footprints (e.g. a typical horse has a 1 × 2 footprint). Unique footprints are listed in Chapters 4 and 6 and more may be introduced with ease.</p><p><strong>Other Effects of Size:</strong> Beyond Defense and Footprint, Size impacts a number of statistics and rules, including wounds (see pages 9 and 230), carrying capacity (see page 154), the armor and weapons a character can use (see pages 173, 176, and 215), natural attacks (see page 237), hiding (see page 71), and the use and effects of certain actions (see page 218). NPC Size is handled in its own section (see page 226).</p><p><strong>Squeezing:</strong> A character may move through a space of at least 1/2 his Footprint (rounded up). While doing so he’s flatfooted, loses dodge bonuses to Defense, and moves at 1/2 normal Speed (rounded down, to a minimum of 10 ft.).</p><h4>Table 5.4: SIZE</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Defense</th><th>Maximum Footprint</th><th>Example Object/Scenery</th><th>Example Creature</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Nuisance (N)</td><td>+16</td><td>32 per square</td><td>Ring</td><td>Housefly</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Fine (F)</td><td>+8</td><td>16 per square</td><td>Vial</td><td>Sparrow</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Diminutive (D)</td><td>+4</td><td>8 per square</td><td>Dagger</td><td>Pigeon</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Tiny (T)</td><td>+2</td><td>4 per square</td><td>Machete</td><td>Eagle</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Small (S)</td><td>+1</td><td>2 per square</td><td>Long sword</td><td>Goblin</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Medium (M)</td><td>+0</td><td>1 square</td><td>Claymore</td><td>Human</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Large (L)</td><td>–1</td><td>3 × 3 squares</td><td>Ballista</td><td>Bear</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Huge (H)</td><td>–2</td><td>6 × 6 squares</td><td>Trebuchet</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Gargantuan (G)</td><td>–4</td><td>12 × 12 squares</td><td>Siege Tower</td><td>Ancient Red Dragon</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Colossal (C)</td><td>–8</td><td>25 × 25 squares</td><td>Galley</td><td>Kraken</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Enormous (E)</td><td>–16</td><td>50 × 50 squares</td><td>Frigate</td><td>Kaiju Creature</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Vast (V)</td><td>–32</td><td>Larger than 50 × 50 squares</td><td>Mansion</td><td>Nothing Yet Discovered</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>STARVATION AND THIRST</h1><p>An active character needs 3 common meals each day (see page 165). At the start of the 4th and each subsequent day a character goes without this minimum sustenance, he makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per previous save). With failure, he becomes fatigued and suffers 1d6 lethal damage + an additional 1d4 lethal damage per day he’s gone without food. The character may not lose the fatigued condition until he consumes at least 1 day’s necessary nourishment.</p><p>Likewise, an active character requires 1 quart of fluids per day, or 2 quarts per day when exposed to any heat over 90° F. At the start of each day a character goes without these minimum fluids, he makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per previous save). With failure, he becomes fatigued and suffers 1d6 lethal damage + an additional 1d4 lethal damage per day he’s gone without fluids. The character may not lose the fatigued condition until he drinks at least 1 day’s necessary fluids.</p><h1>SUFFOCATION</h1><p>A character may hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to his Constitution score. At the start of each round thereafter, he makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per previous save). With failure, his vitality drops to 0 (if he’s a special character), or he falls unconscious (if he’s standard). At the start of his Initiative Count during the following round, the character must start breathing if he’s able. If not, his wounds drop to 0 (if he’s a special character) and he begins to die regardless of his type.</p><h1>TERMINAL SITUATIONS</h1><p>Characters sometimes find themselves in appalling peril. They fall from dizzying heights. They’re at the center of firestorms cast down by gods. They find assassins standing beside their beds in the morning, holding knives to their throats. Fantasy Craft calls these “Terminal Situations.”</p><p>Outside combat only, the GM may declare that any situation from which a character cannot logically escape is a Terminal Situation. Until the situation passes, any opponents within Melee Range may spend 1 action die to cause the victim to either fall unconscious or die, as appropriate to the circumstances at hand.</p><h1>UNDERWATER COMBAT</h1><p>While underwater, a character possessing 4 or fewer ranks in Athletics suffers a –2 penalty with all attack checks, Reflex saves, and skill checks (except Athletics checks made to swim). Also, the blast increment of any explosive set off underwater is doubled. Swimmers don’t suffer these penalties (see page 227).</p><h1>VISION AND HEARING</h1><p>A character can see up to 10 visual range increments (each equal to his Wisdom score × 10 ft.), hear up to 10 hearing range increments (each equal to his Wisdom score × 5 ft.), and smell up to 10 scent range increments (each equal to his Wisdom score × 1 ft.). Various character options and circumstances modify these base range increments, as shown on Table 5.5: Vision and Hearing (see page 218).</p><p>While conditions reduce a character’s vision increment to 0 ft. or below he is blinded, and while conditions reduce a character’s hearing increment to 0 ft. or below he is deafened.</p><p>Vision and hearing also affect many skill checks, including Blend and Sneak (see pages 71 and 82, respectively). Ambient light also applies a modifier to Defense, as shown on Table 5.5: Vision and Hearing (see page 218).</p><h4>Table 5.5: VISION AND HEARING</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th>Circumstance</th><th>Visual Increment</th><th>Hearing Increment</th><th>Defense</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Ambient Light</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">None (e.g. pitch black)</td><td>Drops to 0 ft.</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Faint (e.g. moonlight)</td><td>–40 ft.</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Dim (e.g. dawn, dusk, or torchlight)</td><td>–20 ft.</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Bright (e.g. daylight)</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Intense (e.g. Glow II spell)</td><td>+40 ft.</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Ambient Noise</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">None (e.g. dead of night)</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>+20 ft.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Faint (e.g. nearby conversation)</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Moderate (e.g. busy tavern)</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>–10 ft.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Heavy (e.g. passing wagon)</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>–20 ft.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Extreme (e.g. battlefield)</td><td>+0 ft.</td><td>–40 ft.</td><td>—</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"ACTIONS","type":"text","_id":"StKpvNzGlewDyCLF","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Actions are key to elevating any combat beyond the sum of its parts. They expand combat beyond merely bashing or stabbing and ensure that everyone can contribute. Every action operates a little differently, but they’re all equally simple to use. Beneath each action’s name line are two items in bold — the number of free, half, or full actions required and the category into which the action falls. There are three categories: Attack, Initiative, and Movement. A character may perform only 1 action at any time.</p><p>Some actions may be taken outside combat, as noted in their descriptions and elsewhere in the rules. The GM is also encouraged to call for them anytime they’re appropriate.</p><h2>STANDARD ATTACK</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character makes 1 attack against 1 target.</p><h2>STANDARD MOVE</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Movement Action</strong></p><p>The character moves up to his Speed in feet.</p><h2>AIM</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Initiative Action</strong></p><p>The character takes a moment to steady his attacks against an opponent. So long as the target does not move more than 5 ft. in any single round, the character gains a +1 bonus with all Standard Attack checks made against him. A character may only aim at 1 target at a time.</p><h2>ANTICIPATE</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Initiative Action</strong></p><p>The character attempts to second-guess an opponent’s upcoming actions. With a successful Sense Motive check (DC 10 + the target’s base attack bonus), the character gains a Defense dodge bonus against the target’s attacks equal to the character’s Wisdom modifier (min. +1). This effect lasts for 1 full round.</p><p>A character may only benefit from 1 Anticipate Action at any time.</p><h2>BULL RUSH</h2><p><strong>1 Full Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character attempts to shove an opponent in a straight line. He moves up to his Speed directly toward 1 opponent whose Size may be up to 1 category bigger than his own. When he enters the opponent’s square, the characters make an opposed Athletics check. If the bullrusher is mounted or operating a personal vehicle he uses the Ride skill instead. The bigger combatant gains a +2 bonus with this check per Size category of difference between them.</p><p>If the bullrusher loses this opposed check, he moves back 5 ft. and becomes sprawled; otherwise, his opponent is pushed directly back 5 ft. + an additional 5 ft. per 4 points of difference between the results, after which he becomes sprawled. If this path is obstructed, the following occurs.</p><p>• An obstructing character makes an Athletics check against the bullrusher’s Athletics result. If he wins, all movement ends and the bullrusher becomes sprawled; otherwise, the obstructing character becomes sprawled in a random adjacent square (using the Deviation Diagram) and the Bull Rush continues past him. With either result, everyone involved suffers the bullrusher’s unarmed damage.</p><p>• An obstructing object makes a Damage save against the bullrusher’s Athletics result. With success, all movement ends and the bullrusher becomes sprawled; otherwise, the Bull Rush punches through the obstructing object and continues past it. With either result, the bullrusher and his opponent both suffer the bullrusher’s unarmed damage.</p><h2>COUP DE GRACE</h2><p><strong>1 Full Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character takes advantage of an adjacent and helpless opponent’s vulnerability. He may knock the opponent unconscious or inflict 1 automatic critical hit against him at no action die cost. If he chooses the second option and the opponent survives, the opponent must also make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the damage inflicted) or die.</p><h2>DELAY</h2><p><strong>1 Free Action • Initiative Action</strong></p><p>The character waits to see what other combatants do by voluntarily reducing his Initiative Count by 1. He may take this action a number of times per round equal to his Initiative bonus + 10, at which point he must act or forfeit his chance to act during the current round. Once the character acts, his Initiative Count resets to its value at the start of the round.</p><h2>DISARM</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character attempts to disarm an opponent. The opponent must be within the character’s Reach (he’s unarmed or using a melee weapon), or within Close Quarters (if he’s using a ranged weapon). The characters make an opposed Standard Attack check. If either character is holding his weapon with both hands he gains an additional +4 bonus. Also, the character with the bigger weapon gains a +4 bonus per Size category of difference (an unarmed character’s “weapon” is 2 Size categories smaller than him). If the character wins, the opponent is disarmed and his weapon lands in an adjacent square (per the Deviation Diagram); otherwise, the disarming character becomes flat-footed.</p><h2>DISTRACT</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Initiative Action </strong></p><p>The character tries to draw an opponent’s attention, keeping him from reacting quickly. He makes a Bluff (Dex) check opposed by the opponent’s Sense Motive. If the character wins, the opponent’s Initiative Count drops by 2d6 for this round only; otherwise, the distracting character becomes flat-footed. </p><p>A character may only be targeted with 1 Distract action during each round.</p><h2>FEINT</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character attempts to dupe an adjacent opponent with a false action, leaving him vulnerable to a different one. He makes a Prestidigitation check opposed by the opponent’s Notice. If the character wins, his opponent becomes flat-footed; otherwise, the feinting character becomes flat-footed.</p><p>A character may only be targeted with 1 Feint action during each round.</p><h2>GRAPPLE</h2><p><strong>1 Full Action • Unarmed/1-Handed Melee Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character tries to wrestle an adjacent opponent whose Size may be no larger than 1 category bigger than his own. He steps into the target’s square and they make an opposed Athletics check. The smaller character gains a +2 bonus per Size category of difference. If the character wins, both combatants remain in the square and the opponent becomes held; otherwise, the character is pushed back into his original square and becomes flat-footed.</p><p>The character may release the opponent at any time as a free action but until he does he remains flat-footed. Further, any combatants may move through adjacent squares without restriction. Finally, the only non-free action any grapple participant may take is an opposed full-action Athletics check, with the bigger character gaining a +2 bonus per Size category of difference. The winner of this check may pin the opponent or choose 1 Grapple benefit (see next).</p><p>Up to 2 characters may grapple a smaller opponent, up to 4 characters may grapple an opponent of the same Size, and up to 8 characters may grapple a larger target. In all cases, the cooperative check rules are used to determine the results (see page 66).</p><h3>GRAPPLE BENEFITS</h3><p><strong>Break Free:</strong> The winner escapes or helps another character escape. If pinned, the character becomes held. If held, the character exits the grapple and moves into an unoccupied adjacent square (this option is unavailable when no squares are open).</p><p><strong>Disarm:</strong> The winner forces 1 grapple opponent to drop 1 weapon in the grapple square.</p><p><strong>Handle Item:</strong> The winner draws or uses a 1-handed weapon or object, dropping another in the grapple square if he carried one. This item may come from his inventory or that of another character in the grapple, so long as it’s readily accessible. This option may be used to unbuckle a character’s armor, decreasing its DR to 1/2 standard (rounded down) until the opponent spends 1 half action outside the grapple to adjust it.</p><p><strong>Injure:</strong> The winner inflicts his unarmed damage or a held 1-handed weapon’s damage upon 1 grapple opponent.</p><p><strong>Grapple Second Opponent (Held Only):</strong> The winner moves the grapple into an adjacent square and targets the second opponent therein with a Grapple action. A character suffers a –4 penalty with all Athletics checks when grappling or holding 2 opponents, and no character may attempt to grapple more than two opponents at a time.</p><p><strong>Move:</strong> The winner moves the grapple into an adjacent square (if holding an opponent) or up to his Speed (if pinning an opponent).</p><p><strong>Screaming Club (Pinned Opponent Only):</strong> The winner picks up 1 smaller grapple opponent and uses him to make 1 melee attack. The opponent is treated as a club of his Size and with a hit both the target and the grapple opponent suffer the appropriate damage.</p><p><strong>Sprawl:</strong> The winner goes prone and forces 1 grapple opponent to become sprawled.</p><p><strong>Throw:</strong> The winner tosses 1 grapple opponent into an unoccupied adjacent square, inflicting his unarmed damage + an additional amount of damage equal to his Strength bonus (min. +1). The opponent leaves the grapple and becomes sprawled.</p><p><strong>Use Opponent’s Weapon (Pinned Only):</strong> The winner uses a grapple opponent’s 1-handed weapon to inflict damage on any 1 character in the grapple (this may be the weapon’s owner).</p><h2>HANDLE ITEM</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Movement Action</strong></p><p>The character draws, sheaths, picks up, or manipulates one weapon or object (dropping an item is a free action).</p><h2>MOUNT/DISMOUNT</h2><p><strong>Full Action • Movement Action</strong></p><p>The character assumes control of a vehicle or trained mount. This requires no skill check if the character is adjacent to the animal or vehicle; otherwise, the character may move up to his Speed to reach the animal or vehicle (as part of this action), but in this case he may only mount or board with a successful Acrobatics check (DC 15).</p><p>When a mount is unwilling, the character must target it with a Grapple check. Achieving a held result gets the character on the mount, at which point the opposed skill check becomes Survival. Should the character achieve a pinned result, the mount calms enough for him to ride it, though the GM may at any time spend 1 action die to remind the mount what it disliked about the proceedings and resume the grapple with the mount held. While a mount is resisting, it moves and acts per the GM’s discretion and may lead the character through difficult areas to try and buck him.</p><h3>PUMMEL</h3><p><strong>1 Full Action • Unarmed Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character attempts to beat an adjacent opponent senseless, possibly knocking him unconscious. He makes an unarmed Standard Attack check against the opponent and with a hit he inflicts triple his unarmed damage as subdual damage. </p><p>Pummel has a special application outside combat. The subdual damage from the first — and only the first — Pummel action against each character made out of combat in each scene is applied normally, except that the target suffers 1 grade of fatigued per 5 by which he fails this save (see page 211). </p><p>Special: This action may never inflict lethal damage.</p><h2>READY</h2><p><strong>1 Full Action • Initiative Action</strong></p><p>The character prepares a half action and a trigger that prompts that action (e.g. attacking the first monster through a door). If the trigger is another character’s action, the acting character’s Ready action occurs first (e.g. the character attacks the monster as it passes through the door, not after). If the trigger doesn’t occur during the current round, the character loses any remaining chances to act, and his Ready action and trigger remain active until the start of his Initiative Count during the following round.</p><h2>REFRESH</h2><p><strong>1 Full Round • Initiative Action</strong></p><p>The character takes a breath and possibly patches up some minor injuries. He cannot be suffering from any conditions to take this action, and he forfeits his chance to act during the current round. Unless he’s targeted by 1 or more attacks before the start of his Initiative Count during the following round, the character may at that point spend and roll 1 action die. A special character recovers 2 wounds and an amount of vitality equal to the die’s result, while a standard character reduces his accumulated damage by the result. If the character is targeted by any attacks during this period (whether they hit or not), he may not spend the die and still loses his chance to act.</p><p>A character may spend only 1 action die to heal per uninterrupted Refresh action.</p><h2>REPOSITION</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Movement Action</strong></p><p>The character assumes a different position. He stands or drops prone, becoming flat-footed in the process.</p><h2>RUN</h2><p><strong>1 Full Action • Movement Action</strong></p><p>The character breaks into a full sprint. If wearing full armor, he may move up to 3× his Speed; otherwise, he may move up to 4× his Speed. A character may only Run in a straight line and becomes flat-footed after taking this action.</p><h2>TAUNT</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Attack Action </strong></p><p>The character attempts to goad an opponent into attacking him. The opponent must be within Close Quarters. The characters make an opposed Sense Motive check. If the character wins, the opponent must attack him with his next available action (unless he physically can’t); otherwise, the opponent may act freely during his next action but also gains a +1 bonus with his next attack against the character during the current combat.</p><h2>THREATEN</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character tries to humiliate an opponent within Close Quarters. The character makes an Intimidate check opposed by the opponent’s Resolve. If the character wins, the opponent suffers 1d6 stress damage; otherwise, the opponent gains a +1 bonus with his next attack against the character during the current combat.</p><h2>TIRE</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character tries to force an adjacent target onto the defensive. He and his target make an opposed Resolve check. If the character wins, the opponent suffers 1d6 subdual damage that ignores Damage Reduction and Resistances; otherwise, the character becomes flat-footed.</p><h2>TOTAL DEFENSE</h2><p><strong>1 Full Action • Movement Action</strong></p><p>The character focuses exclusively on defending himself. He may take 1 Standard Move action and gains a +4 dodge bonus to Defense for 1 full round.</p><h2>TRIP</h2><p><strong>1 Half Action • Attack Action</strong></p><p>The character attempts to trip an adjacent opponent whose Size may be no larger than 1 category bigger than his own. The characters make an opposed Acrobatics check. The bigger character gains a +2 bonus per Size category of difference. If the character wins, the opponent becomes sprawled; otherwise, the tripping character becomes flat-footed.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"ADVANCED ACTIONS AND TRICKS","type":"text","_id":"KpRD65IOTOEUltj7","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Where standard actions are available to everyone, advanced actions are reserved for those who devote special attention to tailoring a personal combat style. They let characters divert weapons training time into developing a customized set of specialized maneuvers. Most of these maneuvers operate like actions, though many also require a character to have a forte with the weapon category to use them.</p><p>Also included in this group are “tricks,” which are ways to modify actions for various results. You may apply a single trick to any action listed in the trick’s description. You may not apply more than 1 trick to any action.</p><p>Each advanced action or trick costs 1 weapon proficiency (see page 28).</p><h1>ARROW CUTTING</h1><p><strong>Initiative Action (Forte):</strong> The character tries to ‘cut a projectile out of the air’ the instant before it hits him. While armed with a melee weapon, once per round after the character’s been hit by a bow or hurled attack but before damage is rolled, he may make a Reflex save (DC equal to the attack check result). With success, the damage drops to 0 (though any special effects from the attack are still felt). The character may take this action a number of times per combat equal to the number of Melee Combat feats he has (min. 1).</p><h1>CALLED SHOT </h1><p><strong>Attack Trick:</strong> The character attempts to find a chink in a target’s armor. He suffers a –3 attack check penalty if the target is wearing partial armor, a –6 penalty if the target is wearing moderate armor, or a –9 penalty if the target is wearing full armor. With a hit, the attack ignores any Damage Reduction provided by the target’s armor.</p><h1>CHEAP SHOT</h1><p><strong>Attack Trick:</strong> The character attempts to exploit an opponent’s obvious weakness. He chooses 1 of the opponent’s attributes or the opponent’s Speed and makes his attack check, suffering a –4 penalty. With a hit, the opponent suffers a –2 penalty with all attack and skill checks using the chosen attribute, or a –10 ft. penalty to his Speed, until the end of the scene. With a miss, the character becomes flat-footed. Each combatant may suffer from only 1 successful Cheap Shot per scene.</p><h1>FORCED OPENING</h1><p><strong>Melee Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character makes a risky attack to spin an opponent about and disorient him. While attacking with a 2-handed melee weapon and not flat-footed, the character may increase his error range by 2 to cause the target to become flanked for 1 full round. With a miss, the character becomes flat-footed at the end of his current Initiative Count.</p><h1>FULLY ENGAGED</h1><p><strong>Melee or Unarmed Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character punishes an opponent who ignores him. When an opponent has been adjacent to the character for at least 1 round and not attacked him since his last Initiative Count, the character may roll damage twice, keeping the result he prefers.</p><h1>DAUNTING SHOT</h1><p><strong>Ranged Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character’s shots upset the target’s courage. With a hit, in addition to suffering normal damage, the target suffers a –2 morale penalty with attacks targeting the character. This effect lasts until the target successfully attacks the character.</p><h1>MIX-UP</h1><p><strong>Trick:</strong> The character is full of surprises, calling upon techniques when they’re least expected. He chooses one of the following actions when he gains this trick: Anticipate, Bull Rush, Disarm, Distract, Feint, Grapple, Pummel, Taunt, Threaten, Tire, or Trip. Once per round, when the character hasn’t taken the chosen action during the last 3 rounds, he may take it and gain a +3 morale bonus with the first attack or skill check it requires. </p><p><strong>Special:</strong> This trick may be gained multiple times, each time for a different action.</p><h1>PARRY</h1><p><strong>Initiative Action (Forte):</strong> The character uses his hands or weapon to knock an incoming attack aside. Once per round when the character’s not flat-footed, after he’s been hit by a melee or unarmed attack but before damage is rolled, he may make a Reflex save (DC equal to the attack check result). With success, the damage drops to 0 (though any special effects from the attack are still felt). The character may take this action a number of times per combat equal to the number of Melee Combat feats he has (min. 1).</p><h1>RAGGED WOUND</h1><p><strong>Melee Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character angles for a long, bloody slash. When making an attack, he may increase his error range by 1 and decrease his damage by 2 to grant his weapon the bleed quality.</p><h1>RELENTLESS ATTACK</h1><p><strong>Attack Trick:</strong> The character focuses completely on one opponent, keeping the pressure on until an attack gets through. If the character’s last attack was also against the current opponent and missed, he gains a +2 bonus with this attack.</p><h1>SALT THE WOUND</h1><p><strong>Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character uses an opponent’s injuries against him. When he attacks an opponent who has the bleeding condition, he inflicts an additional 1d6 damage.</p><h1>SHIELD BLOCK</h1><p><strong>Initiative Action:</strong> The character uses his shield to absorb what might otherwise be a solid hit. Once per round when the character has a readied shield and isn’t flat-footed, after he’s hit by an unarmed or melee attack but before damage is rolled, he may make a Fortitude save (DC equal to the attack check result). With success, the attack’s damage drops to 0 (though any special effects from the attack are still felt). The character may take this action a number of times per combat equal to the number of Melee Combat feats he has (min. 1).</p><h1>SHOVE </h1><p><strong>Melee or Unarmed Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character uses an attack’s momentum to drive his opponent back. With a hit against a target of equal or smaller Size, the character pushes the target back 5 ft. He may follow to remain adjacent to the target or stay in his current location.</p><h1>STEADY SHOT </h1><p><strong>Bow or Hurled Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character parlays familiarity with his surroundings into a deadly barrage. If he hasn’t moved from his current location in the last 2 rounds, he gains a +2 bonus with bow and hurled attack checks.</p><h1>TRIUMPHANT SWING</h1><p><strong>Melee Attack Trick:</strong> Feeling the tide of battle turning in his favor gives the character the will to fight on. While attacking a special opponent, the character may increase his error range by 3, recovering 1d6 vitality with a hit. With a miss, the character becomes flat-footed at the end of his current Initiative Count. The character may use this trick a number of times per combat equal to the number of Melee Combat feats he has (min. 1).</p><h1>VENOM MASTER</h1><p><strong>Attack Trick:</strong> Poisoned weapons are very dangerous in the character’s hands. When he makes an attack with the poisonous or venomous quality, he may raise his error range by 1 to lower the poison’s first Incubation Period to Instant. With a miss, the character becomes flat-footed at the end of his current Initiative Count. The character may apply this trick a number of times per combat equal to the number of Covert feats he has (min. 1).</p><h1>WARDING STRIKE</h1><p><strong>Melee Attack Trick (Forte):</strong> The character claims his ground, daring anyone to force him from it. After one or more hits, the character gains a +2 morale bonus with Fortitude and Reflex saves until he leaves his current square.</p><h1>WHIRLING STRIKE</h1><p><strong>Melee Attack Trick:</strong> The character attacks with overwhelming speed. While attacking with two or more 1-handed melee weapons, the character may increase his error range by 2 to set the attack’s minimum damage to his Dexterity modifier (min. 1), even with a miss. The character may take this action a number of times per combat equal to the number of Melee Combat feats he possesses (min. 1).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"RESTRICTED ACTIONS","type":"text","_id":"0DWp495RerhymOYb","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Finally, restricted actions are available only through specific character options and rules, as noted in their bolded action lines. These actions include powerful Species abilities, benefits of special class training, and more.</p><h1>GAZE ATTACK</h1><p><strong>1 Half Action • Ranged Attack Action • Requires Gaze Attack</strong></p><p>Gaze attacks are made with just a glance and have many different effects, from petrifying targets to driving them away in fear. They require no proficiency or gear, and ignore Size modifiers to Defense. Gaze attacks may only be made within a distance equal to 1/2 of one visual range increment (rounded up), and automatically miss blinded, hidden, and invisible targets. </p><p>Finally, a special critical failure is possible with any gaze attack: if a mirrored surface is located within the attacker’s line of sight when he suffers an error, an opponent may spend 4 action dice to cause the attacker to view his own reflection, suffering the gaze attack’s effects. When a gaze attack’s target wields a mirror or other smooth reflective surface, this cost decreases to only 1 action die.</p><p>A character may only make 1 gaze attack at a time; when he possesses more than one gaze attack, he chooses one each time he takes this action.</p><h1>SWALLOW</h1><p><strong>Grapple Benefit • Requires Swallow Natural Attack</strong></p><p>With a critical success during a Grapple Athletics check, the character may use 1 Grapple benefit to consume a target 2 or more Sizes smaller than himself, inflicting his Swallow natural attack damage in the process. The grapple ends and the victim is subject to suffocation (see page 217). The victim cannot act except to make an opposed Athletics or attack check to escape. The character suffers a –2 penalty with all attack and skill checks until his new meal escapes or expires (and stops struggling). </p><p>Should the victim win an opposed check to escape, he exits the character’s gullet, inflicting his unarmed or weapon damage along the way. Until then, however, he suffers the character’s Swallow damage at the end of each round.</p><p>A character digests 1 swallowed target every 12 hours and may not add a new meal beforehand, though he could voluntarily throw a previous victim up with 1 full action so he could enjoy a new delicacy.</p><h1>TRAMPLE</h1><p><strong>1 Full Action • Unarmed Attack Action • Requires Trample Natural Attack</strong></p><p>The character moves up to his Speed through areas occupied by targets 2 or more Sizes smaller. He doesn’t have to stop when he moves past or through conscious opponents, though he does have to end his movement in an unoccupied area. At the end of the character’s movement, he makes a single Trample attack and the result is compared to the Defense of each opponent run over during the move. The second and each subsequent opponent gains a cumulative +2 bonus to defense against this attack (+2 for the second, +4 for the third, and so on). Damage is rolled separately for each opponent hit. Targets hit by this attack must also make a Fortitude save (DC equal to the damage) or become sprawled.</p><h1>TURN</h1><p><strong>1 Full Action • Attack Action • Requires Turning Ability</strong></p><p>‘Turning’ is the process of willfully or spiritually rebuking a target, attacking its will to fight. Each turning ability targets only 1 Alignment or NPC Type (e.g. construct, undead, etc.), having no effect on other Alignments or Types.</p><p>When a character uses a turn ability, each qualifying NPC within 30 ft. makes a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the character’s Resolve bonus, rounded up). Mobs make only 1 save each for the whole unit. Special characters can partially resist turning actions, gaining a +4 bonus with their save.</p><p>With success, a target must move away from the character via the most direct path available, until at least 30 ft. away. With failure, the target becomes frightened of the character. These effects last a number of rounds equal to 1d4 + the character’s Charisma modifier (min. 1).</p><h1>WING BUFFET</h1><p><strong>1 Full Action • Attack Action • Requires Winged Flight Speed</strong></p><p>The character flaps his wings vigorously, creating a momentary gale. Each smaller target within a cone facing in a direction of the character’s choice and with a length equal to the character’s winged flight speed makes a Reflex save (DC equal to the character’s Strength score). This DC increases by 4 per Size category of difference. With success, the target is pushed 1 square away from the character. With failure, the target is pushed 1d4 squares away and becomes sprawled.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"fantasycraft","systemVersion":"0.88","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676925480216,"modifiedTime":1677385096142,"lastModifiedBy":"MbxEaKeEd7aIBbFb"},"_id":"rdjsK3PbUeETn0fH","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"MbxEaKeEd7aIBbFb":3}}

This chapter offers a hassle-free way to create any non-player character or monster you can imagine. Gone are arcane processes — this fast and flexible system builds just the right friend or foe, right now! Better yet, Fantasy Craft NPCs and monsters automatically scale to match the players’ Career Levels, making them useful without modification throughout your entire campaign!</p><p>Conversion rules are included so you can make use of all those OGL products you’ve collected over the years (see page 295), but you can get started with dozens of pre-built friends and foes in the Rogues Gallery and Bestiary (see pages 244 and 253, respectively).</p><h1>NPC BASICS</h1><p>Fantasy Craft features two types of non-player characters (NPCs): <strong>standard</strong> and <strong>special</strong>. Standard characters populate the backdrop and rarely contribute significantly to the world or the plot. Few have names. Special characters, on the other hand, are focal points in the setting or story — they always have names and tend to have significant power or authority. They’re also harder to kill than standard characters, have access to exclusive abilities, and trigger special rules in and out of combat.</p><p>Any NPC may be standard or special (see page 337). The choice is entirely up to the GM, based on the needs of the adventure. To qualify as a special character, an NPC should play an important role in the adventure, pose a significant challenge to the party, or be important to the GM’s plans; otherwise, he should probably be standard.</p><h2>ADVERSARIES</h2><p>The GM may further define any NPC as an adversary, making the character an antagonist of the story and/or an intended threat to the party. Adversaries trigger various rules and are vulnerable to certain hero abilities. Like all NPCs, they can be standard or special (see page 337).</p><h2>ROGUES AND MONSTERS</h2><p>Traditional NPCs (e.g. shopkeepers, town guards, etc.) are presented in the Rogues Gallery (see page 244), while monsters (e.g. kobolds, gelatinous cubes, and dragons) are found in the Bestiary (see page 253). This is merely for convenience, however, as the same rules are used to build both. They utilize very different options, of course, but they share similar stats and interact with the rest of the game in the same way. Outside the specific rules for each NPC’s stats, no special rules are required to use any living being in Fantasy Craft, no matter how civilized it is, what it’s made of, how many legs it’s got, how it sees, or anything else. All that’s important is whether each individual NPC is standard or special, and whether it’s an adversary or not.</p><p>For simplicity, the term “NPC” refers to everything this chapter can create, from people to animals to monsters.</p><h1>BUILDING AN NPC</h1><p>Players sometimes use these rules to build followers (see page 98), contacts (see page 191), and hirelings (see page 190). Most of the time, however, this chapter is the province of the GM, who uses it to create all the other people and monsters the party meets and fights.</p><p>Building an NPC is a simple process that begins with a blank NPC Record Sheet. You can download one from www.craftygames. com or photocopy page 400 of this book. Then just follow these steps. Detailed instructions are provided for each step beginning on the pages listed in parentheses.</p><p><strong>Step 0: Concept (right):</strong> Start with the basics. Are you building a person, animal, or monster? They all use the same rules but the choices to be made in later steps are very different. Think a bit about the NPC’s appearance, motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. Your initial thoughts should be enough to decide whether the NPC is standard or special, and whether it should be an adversary.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Statistics (page 226):</strong> Like player characters, NPCs have attributes, skills, initiative and attack bonuses, Defense, saves, and other statistics. Unlike PCs, a streamlined system is used to generate an NPC’s stats, making them faster to build and easier to use. This system also produces part of the NPC’s total XP value.</p><p><strong>Step 2: NPC Qualities (page 230):</strong> NPCs also differ from player characters in that they don’t gain Origins or class levels. Instead, they have access to “NPC qualities,” which grant them special abilities and powers and sometimes assign weaknesses as well. Each quality also has an XP value, which is applied to the base total generated in Step 1.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Attacks (page 235):</strong> NPCs can use dozens of different attacks: weapons, claws, bites, breath weapons, paralyzing gazes, and more. Special attacks are handled in this step and add to the NPC’s XP value based on type, strength, range, and upgrades. Weapon-using NPCs are equipped in Step 4.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Gear and Treasure (page 239):</strong> Gear assigned to a player-created NPC increases its total XP value, as the NPC is assumed to be using the gear in the party’s favor. Gear and treasure added to a GM-created character, however, has no XP value. This is because anything held by the GM’s characters either doesn’t affect the PCs (weapons carried by non-combatants, for example), or is seized by the party when the fighting is done (the case with nearly all adversaries). Seized gear and treasure is its own reward and therefore generates no XP.</p><p><strong>Step 5: XP Value (page 240):</strong> This step is only important for adversaries and NPCs the players build. For adversaries, the total XP from Steps 1–3 becomes the adversary’s bounty, or reward the characters gain for defeating the NPC (in or out of combat). For player-built NPCs, the total XP from steps 1–4 must fall within the amount allotted by the rule granting the follower, contact, or hireling.</p><p>All other NPCs — the myriad inhabitants of the world that don’t oppose or help the characters — don’t need an XP value; the GM simply assigns them whatever stats, qualities, and other features he feels best fits the needs of the setting and story.</p><h1>STEP 0: CONCEPT</h1><p>Start with a basic idea: perky sidekick, morose pack laborer, stalwart champion, devious bandit king, rampaging wyvern, mercenary goon, vicious kobold, or whatever’s needed. The advice for conceiving player characters is equally helpful here, so it might be a good idea to give that section a read before getting started (see page 7). The main difference is that NPCs generally require far less detail — a single paragraph for major personalities and a few words for others is plenty. Focus on the most fundamental or obvious traits. Here’s a sample set of questions to get you started.</p><p><strong>Visual Cue(s):</strong> What is the NPC’s most distinctive or memorable feature? Answers might include tribal tattoos, a guttural growl, a pronounced limp, or an “interesting” smell.</p><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> What does the NPC want? Answers might include money, power, revenge, or adventure. How does this apply to the characters? Does he want to join them? Hunt them? Manipulate them?</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> What does the NPC do well? What are his most common tactics? (The answers to these questions don’t necessarily have to be the same.) Answers might include brute force, manipulation, subterfuge, or stealth.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> What are the NPC’s shortcomings? Especially if he’s an adversary, how can the PCs exploit him? Answers might include cowardice, pride, greed, or vulnerability to a particular situation or type of damage.</p><p>NPCs also have Dispositions (see page 373). This value is often pre-set for a player-created NPC but otherwise it’s helpful to start thinking about how the NPC views the world and the party. You might already know the NPC well enough to decide but don’t worry if you’re unsure — Disposition doesn’t impact the NPC’s XP value and may be set at any point in the process, or even during play for non-pivotal characters.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"STEP 1: STATISTICS","type":"text","_id":"n5KNNFnPkmTTMo0S","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>An NPC’s statistics, or “stats,” consist of Size, Type, Mobility, Attributes, Traits, Health, and Signature Skills. They’re assigned independently from one another, allowing you to create the character you want without worrying about the effects of any single statistic on the others (though attribute modifiers do impact some of the other stats). There’s no rule to determine each stat — it’s purely a matter of what “feels” right. Go with your gut and adjust as you get comfortable with how the numbers perform at the table.</p><h1>SIZE</h1><p>The full range of options is listed on Table 5.4: Size (see page 217). An NPC’s Size doesn’t impact his XP value — just run with whatever works best. If you assign a Size larger than Medium, define the NPC’s footprint, which can have any dimensions up to the listed maximum.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM wants to build an old standby for his campaign, an owlbear. It’s a hulking brute the size of a grizzly or an ogre, so the GM makes it Large (footprint 2×2).</p><p><em>Example:</em> Later, the GM builds a character he calls “Fortunado,” who initially serves as a friendly rival to the PCs — until it’s revealed he’s spying on them for the story’s Big Bad. Fortunado is an average human, so the GM makes him Medium.</p><p>A related stat is Reach. Each NPC starts with a base Reach of 1 (square, or 5 ft.), which adds no XP. This is enough for most NPCs but those with unusual physiology and special abilities may deserve a higher value. Increased Reach increases the NPC’s XP value by the same amount.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The owlbear’s not particularly long-armed, so the GM keeps its Reach at 1. This adds no XP, so the owlbear’s XP starts at 0.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Fortunado’s Reach is likewise set to 1. His XP starts at 0 as well.</p><h1>TYPE</h1><p>Fantasy worlds are full of creatures that defy conventional classification: acidic slimes lurking in dank dungeons, digesting anything they creep across; dark horrors stalking the night, born in realms without dimension; and lumbering golems of stone and steel that live without souls, animated by their masters’ magical will. Even so, every creature falls into a rough category, called a “Type,” which defines its fundamental characteristics.</p><p>Every NPC has at least one Type and some that straddle the boundaries of physiology have two or more. Most Types add 0 XP but a few offer sufficient advantage to add 5 XP to the character’s total value.</p><p><strong>Animal (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC is non-sapient, relying on base instinct and natural ability to survive. Its Intelligence score may not be higher than 6 and it may not become proficient except with extraordinary and natural attacks. The NPC doesn’t have a Competence bonus but it may gain Acrobatics, Athletics, Blend, Intimidate, Notice, Resolve, Search, Sense Motive, Sneak, Survival, and Tactics as Signature Skills. Unless otherwise specified, the GM determines whether any animal is trained. A trained animal can be ridden, accepts commands, and may receive advanced training (see page 83). An animal ages and must eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><strong>Beast (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC resembles and is easily mistaken for an animal but may have any Intelligence score. It lacks hands or other fine manipulators and can’t take actions requiring them. It can only use armor, handheld gear, and non-natural weapons specifically modified for its use. A beast ages and must eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><strong>Construct (+5 XP):</strong> The NPC is inorganic or manufactured. It’s immune to Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, sneak attack, stress, and subdual damage, as well as poison and disease. It can’t fall unconscious and never gains the bleeding, enraged, fatigued, fixated, frightened, paralyzed, shaken, or sickened conditions. The NPC only suffers 1 kind of critical injury — severe internal damage (–4 to random physical attribute) — on a result of 51 or higher. It regains vitality normally but does not naturally heal wounds, though it may be Mended with a successful Crafting check using the Medicine rules (see page 77). It becomes inert when reduced below 0 wounds but only “dies” when destroyed (i.e. reduced to –25 wounds or worse). A construct doesn’t age and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or breathe.</p><p><strong>Elemental (+5 XP):</strong> The NPC is a physical incarnation of a natural or primal force, without tissue, organs, or other signs of biological life. It’s immune to poison, disease, subdual damage, and sneak attack damage. It can’t fall unconscious and never gains the bleeding, flanked, paralyzed, or sickened conditions. The NPC can’t suffer critical injuries and is banished instead of dying. An elemental doesn’t age and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or breathe.</p><p><strong>Fey (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC has a deep supernatural connection to the wilds and is as much a spiritual embodiment of a natural force or location as a creature of flesh and blood. Natural animals refuse to attack the NPC and often flee from it unless they’re trained to hunt fey or they’re attacked by the NPC or its teammates. A fey doesn’t age but must eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><strong>Folk (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC is a tool-using, civilized creature with linguistic skills. It often lives with others of its kind and frequently bonds with other folk species, valuing cultural identity above racial solidarity. A folk character ages and must eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><strong>Horror (+5 XP):</strong> The NPC has an alien appearance or psychology that undermines an observer’s psyche. Any character other than one of the NPC’s teammates who see it suffers a –3 morale penalty with Will saves. Natural animals refuse to attack the NPC and often flee from it unless they’re trained to attack horrors or they’re attacked by the NPC or its teammates. The NPC is extremely resilient to injury, gaining a +4 bonus with Fortitude saves. Threat ranges of attacks made against it decrease by 2 and it suffers only 1/2 normal sneak attack damage (rounded down). A horror ages and must eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><strong>Ooze (+5 XP):</strong> The NPC’s amorphous, boneless body can twist, compress, and shift in a fluid fashion. Its Size is considered 1 category larger when resisting Bull Rush, Disarm, Grapple, and Trip actions, and up to 2 categories smaller when squeezing into or through confined spaces. The NPC may hold a number of readied items or weapons up to 3 + its Dexterity modifier (minimum 1), but can only use armor specifically designed for an ooze. An ooze doesn’t age but must eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><strong>Outsider (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC is an abstract notion or ideal manifesting in the physical world as either flesh and blood or an animate object. If it has an Alignment, its attacks gain that Alignment and it inflicts +2 damage per die against targets with the opposing Alignment. When the NPC dies, it is instead banished. An outsider doesn’t age and doesn’t have to eat but must sleep and breathe.</p><p><strong>Plant (+5 XP):</strong> The NPC is an animate plant. It gains the aquatic I and light sleeper NPC qualities at no additional cost and is immune to diseases, poisons, sneak attack damage, and the fixated, paralyzed, and sickened conditions. A plant ages and must eat, sleep, and breathe.</p><p><strong>Spirit (+5 XP):</strong> The NPC is a ghost or otherworldly creature who lingers here by sheer force of will. It may spend 1 full action becoming incorporeal and vice-versa, and automatically becomes incorporeal if knocked unconscious. When the NPC dies, it is instead banished. A spirit doesn’t age and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or breathe.</p><p><strong>Undead (+5 XP):</strong> The NPC is a supernatural force clothed in the physical or spiritual remains of a once-living creature. It gains the darkvision I and light-sensitive NPC qualities at no additional cost, can’t fall unconscious, and is immune to Constitution damage, subdual and stress damage, diseases, and poisons, as well as the bleeding, paralyzed, sickened, and stunned conditions. It’s also immune to critical injuries other than battered and broken limbs, suffering the former with any result below 30 and the latter with any other result. The NPC suffers damage instead of healing from Light spells and heals instead of suffering damage from Darkness spells. It regains vitality normally but does not naturally heal wounds, though it may benefit from all Medicine checks as normal (see page 77). An undead NPC doesn’t age and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or breathe.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The owlbear is a bestial creature, capable of only limited reasoning and intellect. After scanning Types, the GM decides it should be an Animal. This adds 0 to the owlbear’s XP (for a total of 0).</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Fortunado is a human and so the GM assigns him the Folk Type. His XP value also remains at 0.</p><h1>MOBILITY</h1><p>Fundamentally, every NPC is a walker, burrower, flyer, swimmer, or immobile. In all cases but immobile, the NPC’s base Speed in his native environment is 30 ft., though you may increase this Speed by adding 1 XP per additional 10 ft. You can decrease this Speed as well though doing so has no impact on XP value.</p><p><strong>Walker (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC has legs and walks, crawls, or slinks on land. He may make Acrobatics and Athletics checks to Climb, Jump, Run, and Swim (and may gain the superior climber, superior jumper, superior runner, and superior swimmer qualities to improve these abilities).</p><p><strong>Burrower (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC tunnels through brittle and soft substances. He can also become a Walker and/or Flyer at 1 XP per 10 ft. of Speed (starting with a base Speed of 0 ft.).</p><p><strong>Flyer (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC flies using wings or other means (e.g. levitation). While in the air, he makes Maneuver checks with the Acrobatics skill (see pages 69 and 80).</p><p>While a winged NPC is in the air, he’s considered 1 Size larger for Defense, as well as Blend and Sneak checks. His error ranges with attacks and Spellcasting checks also increase by 2 (or 4 while he hovers).</p><p>The NPC can also become a Walker and/or Burrower at 1 XP per 10 ft. of Speed (starting with a base Speed of 0 ft.).</p><p><strong>Swimmer (+0 XP):</strong> The NPC is legless and may only travel through liquid. He can’t Climb but may Jump out of liquid and “Run” through it (and may gain the superior jumper and superior runner qualities to improve these abilities). He can swim without making Athletics checks. He must regularly surface for air unless he has the aquatic quality but suffers no penalties for fighting underwater (see page 217).</p><p><strong>Immobile (–5 XP):</strong> The NPC is stationary and cannot move (e.g. he’s permanently rooted in the terrain or bound by permanent magic).</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM doesn’t think the ungainly owlbear should be any quicker than the average human, so he makes it a Walker with a Ground Speed of 30 ft. (same as a human’s base Ground Speed). This adds no XP and the owlbear’s value remains at 0.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Fortunado is also a Walker but might need to flee quickly, so the GM assigns a Ground Speed of 40 ft. This brings Fortunado’s XP value to 1.</p><h1>ATTRIBUTES</h1><p>NPCs have all six basic attributes — Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma — and they work just as they do for player characters, except for Lifestyle (which NPCs don’t have), and Health (see right). Each attribute starts at 10 (+0 modifier), though they can be increased by adding the same amount to the NPC’s XP value. They can be decreased as well, though this has no effect on XP value.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The owlbear is animalistic and reasonably strong, rugged and simple-minded. The GM assigns it Str 14, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 4, Wis 10, and Cha 10, which increases its XP by 10 (+4 for Strength and +6 for Con). This is the first XP added to the owlbear, so its value starts at 10.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Fortunado needs to be impressive as he may wind up squaring off with the party, so the GM assigns him Str 14, Dex 16, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 12, and Cha 16, which translate to 26 XP. This brings Fortunado to 27 XP.</p><h1>TRAITS</h1><p>NPCs have five Traits — Initiative, Attack, Defense, Resilience, and Competence — each of which is scored with a Roman Numeral grade ranging from I to X (1 to 10). When the NPC is prepped for play (see page 240), each Trait’s grade is cross-referenced with the adventure’s Threat Level to determine a numerical bonus, as shown on Table 6.1: NPC Traits (see page 229).</p><p><strong>Initiative:</strong> The NPC’s base Initiative bonus, to which his Dexterity modifier is added.</p><p><strong>Attack:</strong> The NPC’s base attack bonus, to which his Strength modifier is added (for unarmed and melee attacks), or his Dexterity modifier is added (for hurled and ranged attacks).</p><p><strong>Defense:</strong> The NPC’s base Defense bonus, which is added with his Dexterity modifier to a base score of 10 (e.g. with a base Defense bonus of +2 and a Dexterity modifier of +1, the NPC’s Defense is 13). Unless the NPC’s Size is Medium, it applies a modifier as well (see page 217).</p><p><strong>Resilience:</strong> The NPC’s base save bonus, to which a modifier is added: Dexterity for Reflex saves, Constitution for Fortitude saves, or Wisdom for Will saves.</p><p><strong>Competence:</strong> The NPC’s base skill bonus, to which key attribute modifiers are added for any non-Signature skill check (except Spellcasting, which NPCs may only gain as a Signature skill).</p><p>Unlike attribute scores, grades don’t necessarily correspond to any human “average,” though it might be helpful to doublecheck the bonus a particular grade generates at the adventure’s Threat Level to make sure it doesn’t seem too high or low.</p><p>Each Trait grade increases the NPC’s XP value by the same amount.</p><p><em>Example:</em> An owlbear is tough, hard-hitting, and durable, so the GM assigns Initiative III, Attack VII, Defense IV, and Resilience V (as an Animal, the owlbear can’t have a Competence score). This generates a total of 19 XP, bringing the owlbear’s value to 29.</p><p><em>Example:</em> For no particular reason other than the GM’s fancy, Fortunado gets Initiative II, Attack V, Defense III, Resilience IV, and Competence V. Fortunado’s XP value also increases by 19, bringing his value to 46.</p><h1>HEALTH</h1><p>As described in Chapter 5, standard characters have Damage save bonuses while special characters have vitality and wounds (see page 206). Both are scored with a Roman Numeral Health grade ranging from I to X (1 to 10).</p><p><strong>Standard Character:</strong> The NPC’s Health grade is cross referenced with the adventure’s Threat Level to determine his base Damage save bonus, to which his Constitution modifier is added. This bonus also increases or decreases by 2 per Size category above or below Medium (minimum +0).</p><p><strong>Special Character:</strong> The NPC’s vitality is equal to his Health grade × the Threat Level × 5, and his wounds are calculated as shown on Table 6.2: NPC Wounds (see page 230).</p><p>An NPC’s Health grade increases his XP value by the same amount.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The owlbear’s a tough customer and gets Health V, bringing its XP value to 34.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM assigns Fortunado a Health score of IV, which brings his XP value to 50.</p><h4>Table 6.2: NPC Wounds</h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">NPC Size</th><th>Wounds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Nuisance (N)</td><td>1/8 Constitution score (rounded up)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Fine (F)</td><td>1/4 Constitution score (rounded up)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Diminutive (D)</td><td>1/3 Constitution score (rounded up)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Tiny (T)</td><td>1/2 Constitution score (rounded up)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Small (S)</td><td>2/3 Constitution score (rounded up)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Medium (M)</td><td>Equal to Constitution score</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Large (L)</td><td>1.5 × Constitution score (rounded up)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Huge (H)</td><td>2 × Constitution score</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Gargantuan (G)</td><td>3 × Constitution score</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Colossal (C)</td><td>4 × Constitution score</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Enormous (E)</td><td>5 × Constitution score</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Vast (V)</td><td>6 × Constitution score</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>SIGNATURE SKILLS</h1><p>Most of the time, an NPC makes skill checks with his Competence bonus (see above). When you want an NPC to be especially adept with a particular activity though, you can assign him one or more Signature Skills. Only skills you expect to regularly come into play should get this treatment, as noncritical Signature Skills needlessly bloat XP value.</p><p>A non-Folk NPC with a Signature Skill does not suffer a penalty for not using a kit (as he uses the skill through natural ability or has adapted accordingly).</p><p>Like a statistic, a Signature Skill is scored with a Roman Numeral grade ranging from I to X (1 to 10), which produces a bonus on Table 6.1 when the NPC is prepped for play. Each Signature Skill grade except Spellcasting must exceed the NPC’s Competence grade and increases the NPC’s XP value by the same amount.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM thinks an owlbear should be an observant stalker of prey, so he gives it Notice IV and Survival IV. This adds 8 XP, bringing the monster’s value to 42.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Needing to pull of prolonged deception, Fortunado receives Bluff VII and Impress VI. This adds 13 XP, making his value 63.</p><p>Spellcasting is only available to NPCs as a Signature Skill. When an NPC has a Spellcasting grade he knows the same number of spells, and when he’s prepped for play he gains double the Threat Level in spell points.</p><p><em>Example:</em> While magical in origin, the owlbear doesn’t use magic, so the GM skips Spellcasting.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Fortunado, on the other hand, works for the campaign’s Big Bad, which the GM decides is a powerful necromancer. He settles on Fortunado being an adept of the black wizard and assigns Spellcasting II, increasing the NPC’s XP value from 63 to 65. Fortunado starts with 2 spells: Command I and Scrye I.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Table 6.1 NPC Traits","type":"text","_id":"S7JjAIq3frRkyToN","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"worlds/degora/assets/pages/vn0my9BZif6LVVMP-pages-S7JjAIq3frRkyToN-image-0kNPHQ0LhWA35e0Y.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"STEP 2: NPC QUALITIES","type":"text","_id":"dtICucrDPEPrlgvf","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Qualities alter an NPC’s flavor, statistics, and abilities. They can boost combat capability, grant superhuman power, and give mechanical weight to story and campaign decisions. In combination with the rest of the NPC system, even a handful of qualities can generate thousands of different NPCs, making them one of the most powerful tools in the GM’s arsenal. It’s easy to overdo it though — more than a few qualities and an NPC can become complicated and hard to use. An NPC’s XP value can also become unnecessarily bloated, granting too high a reward for defeating it. Except for truly landmark characters, you should probably add no more than 3–5 qualities per standard NPC and no more than 5–7 per special NPC.</p><p>Many qualities may be applied multiple times. Any that don’t specifically mention this, however, may only be applied once.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM wants the owlbear’s qualities to reflect both its root species. On the bear side, he assigns damage reduction 2 (+6 XP), grappler (+2 XP), and fearless I (+2 XP). Owls have excellent eyesight and deadly claw attacks, so the GM also assigns improved sense (sight) and rend for an additional 4 XP. All this adds up to an additional 14 XP, bringing the owlbear’s value to 56.</p><p><em>Example:</em> In keeping with his desire to keep Fortunado alive, the GM gives him cagey II (+2 XP), which lets him automatically succeed with 2 saves per scene. He also adds class ability (Mage: arcane wellspring I) for 4 XP, which lets Fortunado cast Level 1 spells without spell points, and for flavor he also adds class ability (Rune Knight: blooding rune) for 2 XP. Two additional spells are added with expanded spellbook (+2 XP), and the GM rounds Fortunado’s package out with critical surge (+2 XP) and story-critical (+0 XP). These six qualities add up to 12 additional XP, bringing Fortunado’s value to 75.</p><h1>NPC QUALITY DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p><strong>Achilles Heel (–2 XP per damage type): </strong>When the NPC suffers damage of the specified type (see page 209) or source (such as a weapon category, NPC Type, etc.), he also suffers an equal amount of lethal damage.</p><p><strong>Always Ready (+2 XP): </strong>The NPC may always act in surprise rounds.</p><p><strong>Aquatic I (+1 XP): </strong>The NPC may hold his breath for a number of minutes equal to 15 × his Constitution score.</p><p><strong>Aquatic II (+3 XP): </strong>The NPC can’t drown, and suffers no penalties when underwater (see page 217).</p><p><strong>Attractive (+1 XP per grade): </strong>The NPC gains an Appearance bonus of +2 per grade.</p><p><strong>Banned Action (+0 XP): </strong>The NPC can’t take certain attack actions (e.g. Bull Rush, Disarm, etc.) or perform certain skill checks (e.g. Jump, Swim, etc.).

Should the character fail the save he dies, rising again 1d6 rounds later as a creature identical to the NPC. The character’s original body is destroyed when he rises.</p><p><strong>• Killing Conversion: </strong>A character killed by the NPC rises again 1d6 rounds later as a creature identical to the NPC. The character’s original body is destroyed when he rises.</p><p><strong>Critical Hesitation (–2 XP): </strong>The NPC wavers when he suffers a critical hit or failure, becoming slowed for 1 round.</p><p><strong>Critical Surge (+2 XP): </strong>The NPC gains clarity with each critical hit or success, also gaining 1 additional half action.</p><p><strong>Damage Defiance (+2 XP per damage type): </strong>The NPC suffers only half damage of a single type or from a single source (such as a weapon category, NPC Type, etc.).</p><p><strong>Damage Immunity (+5 XP per damage type): </strong>The NPC is immune to damage of a single type or from a single source (such as a weapon category, NPC Type, etc.).</p><p><strong>Damage Reduction (+3 XP per point): </strong>The NPC gains 1 Damage Reduction.</p><p><strong>Darkvision I (+1 XP): </strong>The NPC ignores penalties from dim and faint light.</p><p><strong>Darkvision II (+3 XP): </strong>The NPC ignores all ambient light penalties.</p><p><strong>Death Throes (+5 XP or +7 XP for a damage type other than lethal): </strong>The NPC thrashes about viciously, explodes, or otherwise inflicts damage when killed.

If he also has an Alignment, he gains its ritual weapon with 1 or more grades and may 2 spend action dice to summon its avatar with 5 or more grades.</p><p><strong>Devour (+3 XP): </strong>The NPC can feed on the dead, gaining incredible strength. This takes a full action and destroys the target body. The NPC gains a +1 bonus with attack checks, skill checks, and damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to the devoured target’s Career or Threat Level.</p><p><strong>Diurnal (–1 XP): </strong>The NPC is most comfortable during the day, suffering a –4 penalty with attack checks, skill checks, and saves at night and in areas with no light.</p><p><strong>Dramatic Entrance (+8 XP): </strong>The scene becomes Dramatic when the NPC arrives (see page 335). If the scene is already Dramatic, the GM gains 1 additional action die per player character that may only be spent to support this NPC’s actions.</p><p><strong>Dread (+2 XP): </strong>Each time an opponent attacks the NPC and misses, the opponent suffers 2 stress damage.</p><p><strong>Everlasting (+0 XP): </strong>Unless the NPC’s body is destroyed, he returns to life at the start of the next adventure (though the PCs may not see him for some time after that).</p><p><strong>Expanded Spellbook (+1 XP per spell — spellcaster only): </strong>The NPC knows 1 additional spell.</p><p><strong>Expertise (+2 XP per skill): </strong>When the NPC takes 10 with the skill it doesn’t take twice as long, and when he takes 20 it takes only 10 times normal.</p><p><strong>Fast Healing (+1 XP): </strong>The NPC heals damage at twice the standard rate.</p><p><strong>Fatal Falls (–1 XP): </strong>The NPC suffers +1 falling damage per die. Falling damage also gains the keen (20) quality.</p><p><strong>Favored Foes (+1 per Type): </strong>The NPC’s threat range increases by 2 when attacking and making Notice, Sense Motive, and Survival checks targeting standard characters of 1 Type (see page 226).</p><p><strong>Fearless I (+2 XP): </strong>The NPC gains a +4 bonus with Morale checks.</p><p><strong>Fearless II (+4 XP): </strong>The NPC is immune to negative Morale effects.</p><p><strong>Fearsome (+2 XP): </strong>Up to 3 times per scene, as a half action, the NPC can invoke fear in all opponents who can see or hear him.

These half actions may only be used to attack and may be used to make multiple extraordinary attacks in the same round. Unless the NPC has only 1 attack, each attack must use a different weapon, extraordinary attack, or natural attack than the last.</p><p><em>Example:</em> An NPC facing a dozen opponents has frenzy I, 2 extraordinary attacks, and 1 natural attack. He may use frenzy to gain 5 half actions he may only use to attack. If he uses one of his extraordinary attacks first, he must use his other extraordinary attack or his natural attack second.</p><p><strong>Frenzy II (+8 XP): </strong>As frenzy I, except that the NPC may frenzy 3 times per combat.</p><p><strong>Frenzy III (+12 XP): </strong>As frenzy I, except that the NPC may frenzy once per round.</p><p><strong>Grappler (+2 XP): </strong>The NPC gains a +2 bonus with Athletics checks made during a Grapple.</p><p><strong>Grueling Combatant (+2 XP): </strong>Each time an adjacent opponent attacks the NPC and misses, the opponent suffers 2 subdual damage.</p><p><strong>Hive Mind (+2 XP): </strong>The NPC shares thoughts and reactions with others of his species within 1 mile.

If this reduces a threat range to less than 20, the attacker may not score a threat.</p><p><strong>Natural Defense (+5 XP or +7 XP for a damage type other than lethal): </strong>The NPC enjoys natural protection that injures close quarters battlers. Each time a character hits the NPC with an unarmed or melee attack, he must make a Reflex save (DC 15) or suffer 1d6 lethal damage.</p><p><strong>Natural Spell (+1 XP per Spell Level): </strong>The NPC can reliably produce 1 specific spell effect per scene. This isn’t traditional spellcasting — for which the NPC needs the Spellcasting skill — but rather a natural ability that operates in all mechanical ways like a spell and produces the same effect. No Spellcasting check or spell points are required. The spell’s save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the NPC’s Threat Level (rounded up), with a Casting Level equal to the NPC’s Threat Level. This quality can be used to replicate hundreds of common monster abilities.</p><p><strong>Never Outnumbered (+2 XP): </strong>The NPC can never be outnumbered (see the Benefit description on page 85).</p><p><strong>Night-Blind (+0 XP): </strong>The NPC’s vision penalties from ambient light are doubled.</p><p><strong>Nocturnal (–1 XP): </strong>The NPC is most comfortable at night, suffering a –4 penalty with attack checks, skill checks, and saves in during the day and in areas with intense light.</p><p><strong>Regeneration (+3 XP per point): </strong>The NPC heals 1 point of damage per round (if he’s a special character, he chooses whether to heal subdual, vitality, or a wound). Also, his critical injuries heal in 1d4 hours instead of 1d4 months and he is only sickened for 1d6 minutes when successfully treated.</p><p><strong>Rend (+3 XP): </strong>Each time the NPC hits an adjacent opponent, he may make a free attack against the same target.</p><p><strong>Repulsive (–1 XP per grade): </strong>The NPC gains an Appearance “bonus” of –2 per grade.</p><p><strong>Shambling (–4 XP): </strong>This NPC may take only 1 half action or 1 full action per round and may not Run or make any free attacks.</p><p><strong>Shapeshifter I (+4 XP): </strong>With 2 full actions, the NPC can assume the form of another NPC whose Size is within 1 category (e.g. Small to Large if the shapeshifter is Medium). The target’s XP may not exceed half the shapeshifter’s own (rounded up). The shapeshifter always retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, as well as this quality. A True Seeing spell reveals the shapeshifter’s base form, which he returns to when killed.</p><p><strong>Shapeshifter II (+8 XP): </strong>As Shapeshifter I, except that the NPC can assume the form of an NPC whose Size is within 2 categories (Tiny to Huge if the shapeshifter is Medium), and whose XP does not exceed the shapeshifter’s own.</p><p><strong>Shapeshifter III (+12 XP): </strong>As Shapeshifter II, except that the NPC can also assume the form of a player character with a Career Level not exceeding the NPC’s Threat Level.

Both NPCs keep the original’s qualities, including this one, though they can’t split again until fully grown. These smaller NPCs mature quickly, their Trait grades each rising by 1 per hour until they reach the full original values.</p><p><strong>Stench (+2 XP): </strong>Each living character coming within 10 ft. of the NPC must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the NPC’s Threat Level) or become sickened for 1d6 rounds. With success, the character becomes immune for the rest of the scene. Characters accustomed to the NPC’s stench are also immune.</p><p><strong>Sterner Stuff (+1 XP): </strong>The keen quality of each attack made against the NPC decreases by 4.</p><p><strong>Story-Critical (+0 XP): </strong>Once per scene, the NPC may Cheat Death with a Petty fate (see page 384).</p><p><strong>Superior Climber (+1 XP per grade — walker only): </strong>With a successful Climb check, the NPC moves the resulting distance one additional time per grade (e.g. an NPC with superior climber III and a result of 10 ft. moves 40 ft.)</p><p><strong>Superior Jumper (+1 XP per grade): </strong>With a successful Jump check, the NPC moves the resulting distance one additional time per grade (e.g. an NPC with superior jumper III and a result of 10 ft. moves 40 ft.)</p><p><strong>Superior Runner (+1 XP per grade): </strong>The NPC’s Speed multiplier when Running increases by 1 per grade.</p><p><strong>Superior Swimmer (+1 XP per grade — walker only): </strong>If the NPC is a walker, he moves the resulting distance one additional time per grade with a successful Swim check (e.g. a walker with swimmer III and a result of 10 ft. moves 40 ft.).</p><p><strong>Superior Traveler (+1 XP per grade): </strong>The NPC’s Travel Speed increases by 1 MPH per grade.</p><p><strong>Swarm (+2 XP): </strong>The NPC can make simultaneous attacks with others of his species. A single attack check is made with a bonus equal to the number of NPCs involved. With a hit, the target suffers the attack’s base damage only once, but it’s multiplied by 1/2 this bonus (rounded down).</p><p><em>Example:</em> Five NPCs of the same species make a swarm attack. They make only 1 attack with a +5 bonus but with a hit they inflict double their base damage.</p><p><strong>Swift Attack (+3 XP per extra attack): </strong>Once per round, the NPC gains 1 free attack.</p><p><strong>Telepathic (+1 XP): </strong>The NPC can mentally communicate with intelligent creatures.</p><p><strong>Tough (+5 XP per grade): </strong>If the NPC is standard, he ignores the effect of 1 failed Damage save per scene per grade. If he’s special, he may ignore all damage from a single critical hit once per scene per grade.</p><p><strong>Treacherous (+5 XP): </strong>If the NPC is standard, he can activate threats as critical hits and successes.

Determining how your NPC defends himself is critical in defining his role and how you use him, so his attacks should ideally be informed by his background, statistics, and qualities.</p><h2>WEAPONS</h2><p>Folk, humanoids, and other tool-using creatures typically attack with unarmed strikes and weapons. Unless they also possess natural or extraordinary attacks, you can skip this step for them, proceeding to page 239.</p><h2>NATURAL ATTACKS</h2><p>Natural attacks include savage bites, lashing tentacles, poisonous stings, and the ability to swallow prey whole! All natural attacks are Standard Unarmed Attacks except where noted, and may not be disarmed.</p><p>An NPC may possess more than one natural attack (e.g. a horse may have Bite and Kick attacks), or more than one of the same natural attack (e.g. a hydra with an identical Bite attack for each head). When an NPC has 3 or more natural attacks, he may spend 1 full action to flurry, attacking once with each of his natural attacks.</p><p>Each natural attack has a grade ranging from I to V (1 to 5). At Grade I the NPC gains the attack listed on Table 6.4: Natural Attacks (see page 237). At Grades II and IV the threat range increases by 1 each, at Grade III the damage dice double, and at the maximum Grade of V the damage dice triple. Each natural attack added increases the NPC’s XP value by 2 per attack grade + 2 per upgrade.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The owlbear rakes its enemies with savage claws. Scanning Table 6.4, the GM decides these are best handled as a Talon attack. Since the owlbear is Large, its Talon attack stats look like this…</p><p><em>• Grade I:</em> 1d8 damage, 20 threat range</p><p><em>• Grade II:</em> 1d8 damage, 19–20 threat range</p><p><em>• Grade III:</em> 2d8 damage, 19–20 threat range</p><p><em>• Grade IV:</em> 2d8 damage, 18–20 threat range</p><p><em>• Grade V:</em> 3d8 damage, 18–20 threat range</p><p>The GM settles on two Grade II Talon attacks with no upgrades, which increases the owlbear’s XP value from 56 to 64 (+4 XP for each attack). The owlbear’s Strength modifier is applied to these attacks, so they inflict 1d8+2 lethal damage.</p><p>Next the GM builds the owlbear’s sharp beak, choosing a Bite I attack with no upgrades (1d10+2 lethal damage, threat 18–20). This increases the creature’s XP value by 2 more (to 66).</p><h4>Table 6.4: Natural Attacks</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Attack (2 XP per Grade)</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Threat Range</th><th>Qualities/Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th></th><th>T or Smaller</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>H-G</th><th>C or Larger</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Bite</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>2d8</td><td>18–20</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Claw/Kick/Slam/Talon</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>20</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Gore</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>19–20</td><td>Bleed</td></tr><tr><td>Squeeze</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>2d8</td><td>2d10</td><td>—</td><td>Grapple benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Swallow *</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>2d8</td><td>2d10</td><td>—</td><td>Grapple benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Tail/Tentacle Slap</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>2d8</td><td>20</td><td>Reach +1</td></tr><tr><td>Trample *</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>1d12</td><td>2d8</td><td>20</td><td>—</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th style=\"width:150px\">Natural Attack Upgrades</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">(+2XP per Upgrade)</th></tr><tr><td>Aligned</td><td>Attack gains aligned weapon quality</td></tr><tr><td>Alternate damage</td><td>Attack inflicts damage other than lethal</td></tr><tr><td>Armor-piercing **</td><td>Attack gains armor-piercing 2 weapon quality</td></tr><tr><td>Bleed</td><td>Attack gains bleed weapon quality</td></tr><tr><td>Diseased</td><td>Transmits disease if target suffers 1 or more damage after Reduction and Resistances</td></tr><tr><td>Finesse</td><td>Attack gains finesse weapon quality</td></tr><tr><td>Grab</td><td>With successful hit, NPC may Grapple target as free action</td></tr><tr><td>Keen **</td><td>Attack gains keen 4 weapon quality</td></tr><tr><td>Reach **</td><td>Attack’s Reach increases by 1</td></tr><tr><td>Trip</td><td>Attack gains trip weapon quality</td></tr><tr><td>Venomous</td><td>Transmits poison if target suffers 1 or more damage after Reduction and Resistances</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>NATURAL ATTACK DESCRIPTIONS</h3><p><strong>Bite:</strong> The NPC inflicts deep wounds with sharp fangs or powerful jaws.</p><p><strong>Claw/Kick/Slam/Talon:</strong> The most common natural attacks all operate the same, with the NPC striking with arms, feet, hooves, or in some cases the bulk of his body.</p><p><strong>Gore:</strong> The NPC impales its foes on horns, spikes, or other bony protrusions.</p><p><strong>Squeeze:</strong> The NPC wraps its limbs or body around its prey, crushing the life out of them.

The attack gains the bleed weapon quality.</p><p><strong>Diseased:</strong> The attack transmits 1 disease from Table 7.8: Diseases (see page 341), exposing any target who suffers 1 or more damage after Reduction and Resistances.</p><p><strong>Finesse:</strong> The attack is light and nimble, gaining the finesse weapon quality.</p><p><strong>Grab:</strong> The attack latches onto the target with each hit, letting the NPC Grapple the same target as a free action.</p><p><strong>Keen:</strong> The attack slices or pierces deeply into the foe’s body, gaining the keen 4 weapon quality.</p><p><strong>Reach:</strong> A long tail, craning neck, or other means increase the NPC’s striking range, increasing the attack’s Reach by 1.</p><p><strong>Trip:</strong> Hooked claws or snaring tentacles easily pull opponents off their feet, granting the trip weapon quality.</p><p><strong>Venomous:</strong> The attack transmits 1 poison from Table 4.12: Poisons (see page 166), exposing any target who suffers 1 or more damage after Reduction and Resistances.</p><h2>EXTRAORDINARY ATTACKS</h2><p>Extraordinary attacks are supernatural or fantastic in nature and range from a dragon’s fiery breath to a basilisk’s petrifying gaze to a plague demon’s sickening aura. Because these versatile attacks can represent literally thousands of different abilities, it’s extremely helpful to start with a solid concept. Ask yourself: does the attack inflict damage or affect the target in another way? Does it require physical contact or is it made over range? Does it affect an entire area and if so, what shape and size? Answering these questions ahead of time will greatly smooth the process.</p><p>There are two types of extraordinary attacks, as shown on Table 6.5 (see page 238): Damage Attacks, which inflict various types of damage; and Save Attacks, which inflict conditions, drain, and other effects. Like a natural attack, an extraordinary attack has a grade ranging from I to V (1 to 5), which defines its effectiveness.</p><p><em>• Damage Attacks:</em> The grade determines the dice used when rolling damage (Grade I is d4, Grade II is d6, Grade III is d8, Grade IV is d10, and Grade V is d12). For example, a Grade IV damage attack inflicts 1d10 damage per 2 NPC Threat Levels.</p><p><em>• Save Attacks:</em> The grade determines the save DC (5 + an additional 5 per Grade). For example, a Grade III save attack requires the target make a successful save (DC 20) or suffer the listed effect.</p><p>An extraordinary attack can also be enhanced with upgrades and/or an Area (see Table 6.5). Each extraordinary attack increases the NPC’s XP value by (the attack’s grade × the listed cost per grade) + the cost of the attack’s upgrades and Area, if any.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Working up Fortunado the Traitor, the GM decides that his necromantic master made various… adjustments to him over the years, one of which granted him the ability to breathe fire. The GM makes this a Grade IV fire damage attack with a 30-ft. cone Area. This increases Fortunado’s XP by 16 (8 for the Grade IV damage attack, 2 for the alternate damage upgrade, and 6 for the 30 ft. cone Area). Fortunado’s XP rises to 91.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Fortunado’s master also gave him a grade III slowing beam attack with a 60 ft. range. This increases Fortunado’s XP by another 15 (9 for the Grade III slowing save attack and 6 for the 60 ft. beam Area). Fortunado’s XP rises to 106.</p><p>An NPC may only make 1 extraordinary attack per round. Extraordinary attacks are Standard Unarmed Attacks unless they have an Area and may not be disarmed.</p><p>With an Area, an extraordinary attack becomes a single Standard Ranged Attack against all targets therein. Each target hit suffers the attack’s damage or must make the attack’s save. In the case of a damage attack, the victim may make a Reflex save (DC 5 + an additional 5 per grade) to suffer 1/2 damage (rounded down).</p><table><thead><tr><th>Attack</th><th>XP

As with gear, treasure doesn’t increase the XP value of a GM-created NPC.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM doesn’t think the owlbear carries much in the way of coin, gear, or magic items, but it’s chock full of trophies. He assigns it “2T,” which adds 0 XP.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Fortunado, on the other hand, has plenty of gear and treasure. The GM gives him partial leather armor and a claymore, plus a mage’s pouch for his Spellcasting Signature Skill. The GM also assigns Fortunado some treasure: 1C, 2G, 1M, and 1T. Despite this haul, Fortunado’s XP remains unaffected. Remember that all of this is stuff the party can seize after they defeat the traitor.</p><p>See page 344 for details about making Treasure Rolls.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"STEP 5: XP VALUE","type":"text","_id":"j9RmFYm8x0QmOMlO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This last step applies only if you’re a player building a follower, contact, or hireling, or the GM building an adversary.

This includes but isn’t limited to Origins, Subplots, and Lifestyle. They can, however, spend Reputation by increasing their XP value by 1/4 the same amount (rounded down).</p><p>An NPC’s personal Threat Level and Career Level are each equal to the current adventure’s Threat Level and his starting action dice, when needed to determine the effectiveness of abilities only, are calculated accordingly (the GM maintains only one actual pool of action dice, as described on page 365). Standard NPCs roll d6 action dice and special NPCs roll 1 die type higher than the highest typically available to player characters.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM introduces Fortunado in an adventure with five PCs whose Career Levels range from 10 to 12. The highest action die type among them is d8 so Fortunado rolls d10s.</p><p>Rules for NPC injury and healing are found in Chapter 5 (see pages 207 and 212, respectively).</p><h1>TIPS &amp; TRICKS</h1><p>The Fantasy Craft NPC system is wildly flexible, capable of creating lowly peasants or world-destroying monsters — all scaled to properly challenge the party — in just a few minutes. This versatility comes at a price, however, as it’s possible (though difficult) to accidentally create NPCs that are unnecessarily lethal or cumbersome. Here are some tips for building fun, effective, and challenging threats for your party.</p><h2>BUILDING A BETTER MONSTER</h2><p>Let’s start with the “big secret”: this system isn’t perfectly balanced. Devious GMs (and players) can game this system by min-maxing stats, abusing qualities, and optimizing attacks. There are a number of reasons for this — the system’s plug and play nature demands that countless stats, qualities, and customized attacks work in tandem; simpler, slightly less balanced mechanics are much easier and faster to use (a major goal of Mastercraft) — but the upshot is that, as in all RPGs, the GM’s judgment is vital to ensuring NPCs are a fun and fair challenge for the characters. It’s critical that the final decision about any NPC rest with him.</p><p>So, about building that better monster… It starts with a solid concept. Ask some basic questions about its ecology. How large is it? Is it domesticated or wild? Is it sapient or animalistic? What does it eat? Where does it live? Are its abilities magical or mundane? All these questions provide guidelines for stats, qualities, and attacks, even if you’re not entirely sure what role the creature will serve in your game.</p><p>When you’re starting to get a picture of the monster in your mind, ask one of the most critical questions: What are its strengths and weaknesses? Even though the NPC system tends not to reward penalties — a low Speed or attribute score doesn’t reduce the NPC’s XP value except in a few very specific circumstances — you should still try to ensure that your monster has weaknesses as well as strengths. There are no perfect specimens in nature and even if there were, they wouldn’t be fun to fight.</p><p>Next, a walkthrough of the some of the more complex parts of NPC creation…</p><h3>MOBILITY</h3><p>Mobility is fairly self-explanatory: unless the creature moves in some special way, it’s probably a walker. Burrowers and flyers can become walkers, allowing them to also swim. In the event that you need a walker to swim particularly well, there’s the superior swimmer quality, which covers most aquatic walkers up to Grade IV. Grades V though VIII are great for legged creatures whose primary method of travel is swimming, or who move through water with the grace and ease of a fish.</p><p>It’s easy to get carried away with Speeds, particularly in the case of flyers (which we as a modern audience can easily view like jets instead of birds). As a general rule, you should avoid giving any creature — no matter its origin or source of mobility — any Speed over 100 ft. Doing so needlessly bloats the creature’s XP and tends to be irrelevant in actual play, boiling down to “anywhere in the combat” every round. If you’re worried about the creature being able to cover ground quickly enough out of combat, consider the superior traveler quality.</p><p>Also, when you want to model clumsy flight and swimming, simply make sure the creature’s Competence is relatively low and don’t give it Acrobatics (which is used for Maneuver checks) or Athletics (which is used for Swim checks). Conversely, you can add these Signature Skills for deft or lithe climbers, flyers, or swimmers.</p><h3>STATISTICS</h3><p>Traits, which are graded from I–X to grant shifting bonuses, can be difficult to gauge. It’s hard to tell how well a creature will perform at the table, especially against a diverse group of characters. Fortunately, there’s a hidden benchmark built into the system: NPC stats tend to hover around those of player characters at Grades II to V (II being roughly equivalent to low-end PC progressions and V being roughly equivalent to the high end). With this in mind, you can make a number of informed decisions when building any NPC, monster or no. Slower than the slowest hero? Initiative I. Mid-range fighter? Attack III or IV. Hardier than the toughest PC? Resilience VI or above. Remember, you can always go back and revise stats if you’re unhappy with the results.</p><p>Attributes can easily contribute to XP bloat (i.e. adding XP value without giving the NPC a meaningful advantage in play). They only offer bonuses at even numbers (+1 at 12, +2 at 14, etc.), so odd numbers do nothing but increase XP value by 1 (animals being a notable exception, as they benefit from odd scores during training). Very high or across-the-board attribute bonuses also contribute to bloat and make the NPC harder to use because the GM has to constantly apply modifiers.</p><p>Signature Skills are a particular culprit for bloat, as it’s easy to envision NPCs having “a little of everything and/or a lot in a few things.” It’s also easy to forget that they’re not player characters. Ultimately, it’s better for an NPC to stick to the small number of skills they’re likely to use in play: three or less is fine for “average” NPCs, or up to five for “high-functioning” characters. When an NPC must be broadly capable, apply a high Competence grade instead (as seen in summoned Advisors on page 119).</p><h3>QUALITIES</h3><p>In a similar vein, beware of overloading NPCs with qualities. The Bestiary offers examples as simple as sheep or as complex as the tarasque but in each case qualities have been carefully chosen to flesh out the creature’s concept. As mentioned in Step 2, it’s important not to pile qualities onto your creation for no reason other than to make it “better.” This dilutes the flavor and impact of all the qualities you add, bloats XP, and makes the NPC harder to use.</p><p>Defensive qualities can also easily get out of hand, particularly damage reduction, damage defiance, and damage immunity (especially defiance or immunity to lethal or subdual damage). Keep in mind, unkillable NPCs aren’t fun. Damage Reduction above 8 essentially renders 75–90% of all mundane weapons useless. Most of the time, you should apply no more than two to three defensive qualities to a creature and make sure they thoroughly support its concept.</p><h3>ATTACKS </h3><p>Natural and extraordinary attacks deserve special attention because, while they can be highly effective ways to represent a creature’s function, they can also be a fast track to XP bloat. They’re attractive to NPC builders because they include lots of interesting effects but again, be careful not to add anything that isn’t strictly necessary.</p><p>When adding natural attacks, consider the damage grade against the heroes’ weapons: Grades I and II are generally comparable to low-damage melee and hurled weapons while Grades III and IV are similar to high-damage melee weapons, black powder weapons, and magic weapons. Grade V attacks can be as effective as artifacts or siege weapons and should be used only in the very rarest of cases. Skim the Bestiary and you’ll notice the scarcity of natural attack Grades III and above. This keeps games from turning into arms races and ensures maximum versatility on the battlefield.</p><p>Extraordinary attacks are tricky. They replicate an incredible range of supernatural effects but, like monsters, only come into their own with a solid concept. Ask yourself several critical questions.</p><p>• <em>Does the attack inflict damage or do something else?</em> Unless it inflicts damage you should probably consider a save attack. </p><p>• <em>Is the attack especially damaging or difficult to resist?</em> If so, a higher grade is in order. This increases damage dice and/ or save DCs. If you need an average, apply Grades II or III. Grade I is intentionally mild and Grades IV and V are truly savage.</p><p>• <em>Does the NPC make the attack in melee or at a distance?</em> An extraordinary attack made in melee often won’t have an Area and may gain the supernatural attack upgrade so it’s triggered by a natural attack hit. At a distance you have to ask yourself…</p><p>• <em>Does the attack affect one target or many?</em> With a single target at range you’re probably looking at a Ray or Gaze attack. For a discriminating Area, consider a Line or Cone. Auras and Blasts should be reserved for truly wide-reaching assaults.</p><p>Finally, watch for ways NPC qualities augment a monster’s attacks. Charge attack, rend, swift attack, and particularly frenzy can greatly expand the volume of attacks your beast brings to bear, while monstrous attack, favored foes, and treacherous vastly improve their lethality. Grueling combatant, fearsome, and unnerving can wear the enemy down in long combats and specialized qualities like grappler and improved stability offer narrowly defined advantages with specific attacks.</p><h3>MAGIC</h3><p>NPCs gain magic ability in three ways: the Spellcasting Signature Skill, the natural spell quality, and the devoted quality. Natural spell is best for inherent abilities, especially those possessed by animals (though some can also be handled as extraordinary attacks). It’s also good for abilities only used infrequently (“once a day” spells in that other game). Toolusing and magic-reliant creatures, plus those with formal magic training, are better off with Spellcasting. It requires a skill check to use but offers far more flexibility than natural spell. Devoted straddles this divide, granting a discreet bundle of once-perscene or at-will spells in a themed pattern. It’s a good fit for focused magic users and divine casters.</p><h3>TREASURE</h3><p>An NPC’s treasure can represent how it lives and what it collects, especially if the NPC is a monster (in which case it can also represent the creature’s physical makeup: an ooze absorbing things it slides over, for example). Poor monsters and animals might have no treasure, or 1 roll in an appropriate category. Humanoids can have 1–3 rolls but even very rich and powerful NPCs shouldn’t have more than 6. Weapons, armor, and other gear can and probably should cut into this limit — often, it’s treasure enough.</p><p>Treasure categories depend greatly on the creature’s physiology and proclivities. Trophies are a perfect fit for beasts with valuable hides, ivory, or other highly sought parts. Supernatural monsters sometimes have Magic treasure, while humanoids and tool-users frequently carry Coin and Gear. Wealthy foes, like merchants, liches, and wizards, are likely to have Coin and/or Loot, and creatures with lairs (like dragons) and immobile NPCs (like plants) often tap the Any category. What’s important is that an NPC’s treasure be that hint of additional flavor showcasing their story; anything more and you risk turning the monster into a goodie piñata for the party.</p><h2>THE ART OF (NOT) KILLING THE PCS</h2><p>Because Fantasy Craft monsters don’t have “levels,” it can be difficult to judge their effectiveness against the player characters. Traits, skills, attacks, and other NPC options scale to the Threat Level, but that only toggles each graded statistic in a vacuum. It doesn’t take into consideration how the sum of the NPC’s parts rates against the party, which is the most important metric when building encounters. Fortunately, there’s another number already available for this purpose — the NPC’s XP value. You can gauge the threat of a single special NPC or a mob of standard NPCs with this handy scale.</p><p><strong>Minor Threat (Up to 40 XP):</strong> The NPC(s) are pushovers, likely possessing sub-par statistics and very few distinguishing qualities. They offer little challenge to the average adventuring party. Examples: Kobold “warriors,” small animals, and most NPCs in the Rogues Gallery</p><p><strong>Average Threat (41–80 XP):</strong> The NPC(s) are a fair-to-middling challenge, with a few useful statistics or abilities. Given the right circumstances, they might prove a reasonable obstacle for the party. Examples: Basilisks, minotaurs, knights, and necromancers</p><p><strong>Significant Threat (81–120 XP):</strong> The NPC(s) have a number of powerful statistics or unusual qualities that set them apart. The party should be cautious opposing them. Examples: Doppelgangers, trolls, and dire animals</p><p><strong>Serious Threat (121–160 XP):</strong> The NPC(s) are extremely competent, with superior stats and powerful qualities that collectively pose a grave threat to the party’s wellbeing.</p><p><em>Examples:</em> Brain fiends, elder elementals, and many demons</p><p><strong>Extreme Threat (161+ XP):</strong> The NPC(s) are party killers, best employed rarely or when the heroes are spoiling for a life-or-death battle. Examples: Dragons, greater demons, and watchers in the dark</p><p><em>As a rule, each additional special NPC or mob of standard NPCs increases the threat by one degree (e.g. from minor to average or from significant to serious).</em></p><p><em>Insight about choosing the right adversaries (beyond the numbers) can be found on pages 328 and 337.

He also gains Bite I (dmg 1d8 lethal, threat 18–20) and its Tail Slap becomes grade I (dmg 1d8 lethal, threat 20, qualities: reach +1) and Tail Slap II (dmg 1d8 lethal; threat 19–20; qualities: reach +1).</p><h2>UNBORN (+4 XP)</h2><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The NPC’s Type changes to Construct and his Defense, Health and Resilience each increase by 1 grade. However, his Charisma decreases by 2, his Speed decreases by 10 ft., and he gains Achilles heel (electrical) and lumbering.</p><h1>BEYOND THE STATS</h1><p>It’s tempting to make NPCs caricatures — after all, many have a life expectancy of a single combat (if that), without much chance for roleplaying beyond a battle cry and a death-rattle. Giving in to this impulse can rob you of valuable opportunities, however. Here are a few ways to spice up your NPCs before sending them into the fray.</p><h2>WHAT’S IN A NAME?</h2><p>Nowhere else are names more telling of a character’s goals, disposition, or history than in fantasy. Here NPCs are named for important traits, great achievements, and family legacies, any of which can become potential adventure hooks. Sometimes a name can spark ideas before the NPC even appears at the table. For example, it’s probably safe to assume that Baron Rakarth Bloodspike, Lord of the Pit is a villain (or at least, a dangerous person). By contrast, Bilbo Appledimple is likely not; in fact, his name pretty obviously indicates he’s a humble Pech farmer.</p><p>To quickly construct an appropriate name for any NPC in the Rogues Gallery, roll 1d20 and consult Table 6.6: Name by Species (see page 250). Follow the pattern, rolling on Table 6.7: Random Name Generator to fill in the blanks and tweak to taste.</p><p>“[Column + Column]” indicates a compound word or twoword name in the order you prefer.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM is naming a male dwarf. He rolls a 7 on Table 6.6, which translates to a first name from Column L and a compound last name from Columns E and A. He rolls a 2, 9, and 6 for these, respectively, which means his dwarf’s first name is Dalgar and his last can be Hearthcrusher, Hearth Crusher, Crusherhearth, or Crusher Hearth.</p><p>Columns K, N, and O are broken into a prefixes and suffixes, or male and female names. “[Column × 2]” in these columns indicates two rolls in the same column, once for the prefix and once for the suffix.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The GM is naming a saurian. He rolls a 2 on Table 6.6, which translates to two rolls in Column O. He rolls a 14 and 19, which means his saurian is either Sserxec or Xylryn.</p><p>These tables can generate silly names, of course, so feel free to ignore or re-roll as needed.</p><h4>Table 6.6: Name

Great villains are likewise defined by their eccentricities (e.g. Gollum’s multiple personalities and obsession with the One Ring, Voldemort’s struggles with manifesting in bodily form, and the unearthly beauty and callousness of The Black Company’s Lady). Just a few distinctive quirks can make an NPC memorable and interesting, not to mention fun to play and encounter. To quickly add some, roll 1d20 up to once per column on Table 6.8: NPC Quirks (see below).</p><h4>Table 6.8: NPC Quirks</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Result</th><th>Appearance</th><th>Mannerisms</th><th>Personality</th><th>Props</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Brawny</td><td>Facial tic</td><td>Brash</td><td>Ornate ring</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Filthy</td><td>Overused saying</td><td>Cautious</td><td>Multiple piercings</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Lanky</td><td>Intoxicated</td><td>Bloodthirsty</td><td>Trophy or medal</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Stunning</td><td>Stutter</td><td>Shifty</td><td>Necklace of ears/fingers/teeth</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Stunted</td><td>Booming voice</td><td>Fearful</td><td>Cool scar</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Rotund</td><td>Gossips</td><td>Stormy</td><td>Missing limb/digit</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Ugly</td><td>Lisp</td><td>Stoic</td><td>Huge weapon</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Refined</td><td>Wrings hands</td><td>Sorrowful</td><td>Lucky charm</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Immaculate</td><td>Poor hygiene</td><td>Penitent</td><td>Heavily tattooed</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Noble</td><td>Limp</td><td>Frantic</td><td>Battered armor</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Military</td><td>Fidgets</td><td>Talkative</td><td>Glasses</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Flamboyant</td><td>Cough/sickness</td><td>Haughty</td><td>Outrageous hair</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Poor</td><td>Gestures with hands</td><td>Learned</td><td>Portrait of loved one</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Impressive</td><td>Mumbles to self</td><td>Assured</td><td>Cane/walking stick</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Scarred</td><td>Tells bad jokes</td><td>Impatient</td><td>Severe expression</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Cute</td><td>Wheezy voice</td><td>Boisterous</td><td>Unibrow</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Sickly</td><td>Mute</td><td>Grumpy</td><td>Distinctive perfume/smell</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Flushed</td><td>Wears distinctive color</td><td>Contrary</td><td>Fine clothing</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Scary</td><td>Complains constantly</td><td>Pessimistic</td><td>Easy smile</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Savage</td><td>Hard of hearing</td><td>Upbeat</td><td>Piercing glare</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>NPC MOTIVATIONS</h2><p>You can also round out an NPC by giving him a purpose beyond furthering the adventure’s plot. Just like a real person, a good NPC has his own goals, dreams, and aspirations, pursuing them whenever he can. Discovering these motivations not only fleshes the NPC out but gives the players more to work with when interacting with him.</p><p>Roll 1d20 and consult Table 6.9: NPC Motivations to get started. The results are written to provide new plot hooks and tasks, should the party wish to explore the NPC’s background or try to get involved in his business. As in all things, GMs should reward players who engage with an NPC’s background in creative ways, both for their commitment to roleplaying and their willingness to look at the NPC as more than an obstacle on the path to victory.</p><h4>Table 6.9: NPC Motivations</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left;width:50px\">Result</th><th>Motivation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Apotheosis: The NPC is looking for allies to help him achieve divinity (or the appearance of such).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Conquest: The NPC seeks champions to help him crush the armies or nation of a rival.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Debt: The NPC owes a great deal of money to another character and must repay it soon. Perhaps the party can stake him...</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Destruction: The NPC wants to tear down the world and needs rough and ready associates to do his dirty work.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Discovery: The NPC seeks lost or rare knowledge — but is afraid to search for them alone.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Errand: The NPC is on a quest and requires the aid of hardy heroes to complete it.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Escape: The NPC is on the run from bounty hunters or the law and needs help from someone who isn’t (at least, not yet).</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Greed: The NPC wants to fill his vaults and coffers and adventurers run into so much treasure…</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Justice: The NPC seeks to right a wrong or capture a law-breaker.

Collectively, they’re sometimes called “monsters” as they’re very different from the heroic species in Fantasy Craft and commonly encountered as foils, foes, and rampaging beasts to be killed and looted. Unlike NPCs in the Rogues Gallery, these creatures aren’t available as contacts, hirelings, or followers except with special GM permission.</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">See the NPC Compendium for all NPC Statblocks here.</span></p><h1><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />MONSTER TEMPLATES</h1><p>The Rogues Gallery and Bestiary contain many examples of “standard” NPCs and monsters but individuals can and should frequently differ. The following templates offer quick, easy-to apply ‘upgrade’ packages to keep the game interesting and the party on its toes. Simply add the listed XP and make the listed changes (plus any other modifications you like), and you’ve got a whole new threat!</p><p><strong>Special Note:</strong> A monster’s XP value does not decrease when a template reduces attribute scores, even if the scores start higher than 10. Similarly, templates may add XP without effect when a template raises a statistic above its maximum or adds a quality the NPC already has. Rule-breaking combinations may also arise, like Competence scores rising above Signature Skills. In these and other cases where templates interact strangely with base NPCs, the GM should make the call that best fits his setting and story.</p><h2>ALPHA (+20 XP)</h2><p>Alpha monsters are chieftains and champions of their race, the strongest and best their kind can muster. They’re often found leading their fellows into battle.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The NPC’s Initiative, Attack, Defense, Health, and Competence rise by I each and his Strength and Dexterity rise by 2 each. He also gains class ability (Captain: battle planning I), treacherous, and veteran II.</p><h3>EXAMPLE: ALPHA HOBGOBLIN</h3><p>This thick-bodied creature is a lord in his clan, guiding younger, weaker warriors into battle by bloody example.</p><p><strong>Alpha Hobgoblin (Medium Folk Walker — 53 XP):</strong> Str 12, Dex 12, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8; SZ M (1×1, Reach 1); Spd 25 ft. ground; Init IV; Atk V; Def IV; Res III; Health IV; Comp II; Skills: Intimidate III, Tactics III; Qualities: Class ability (Captain: battle planning I), darkvision I, fearless I, feat (Shield Basics), treacherous, tricky (Fully Engaged), veteran II</p><p><em>Attacks/Weapons: </em>Halberd (dmg 1d10+1 lethal; threat 19–20; qualities: AP 4, reach +1), short sword (dmg 1d8+1 lethal; threat 19–20; qualities: keen 4), metal shield (dmg 1d4+1 subdual; threat 20; qualities: guard +2)</p><p><em>Gear: </em>Partial scalemail with light fittings (DR 4; Resist Edged 2; DP –2; ACP –2; Spd –5 ft.; Disguise –12)</p><p><em>Treasure:</em> 2C, 1G</p><h3>EXAMPLE: ALPHA SABER-TOOTH TIGER</h3><p>An exceptionally dangerous specimen, this wizened hunter is always found at the front of his pack, inspiring the rest to greater skill and deadliness.</p><p><strong>Alpha Saber-Tooth Tiger (Large Animal Walker — 90 XP):</strong> Str 20, Dex 16, Con 10, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 8; SZ L (1×2, Reach 1); Spd 30 ft. ground; Init VI; Atk VII; Def IV; Res V; Health VI; Comp —; Skills: Athletics III, Notice V, Sneak III; Qualities: Class ability (Captain: battle planning I), damage defiance (cold), rend, treacherous, veteran II</p><p><em>Attacks/Weapons: </em>Bite V (dmg 3d10+5 lethal; threat 16–20; upgrades: grab), Claw II (dmg 1d8+5 lethal; threat 19–20)</p><p><em>Treasure:</em> 3T</p><h2>ANCIENT (+20 XP)</h2><p>Experience is a valuable asset — and one that few monsters gain with “adventurer” becoming such a popular career path. Ancient NPCs are methuselahs of their kind, slightly diminished in body but greatly strengthened in mind. They’re commonly surrounded by younger, stronger specimens and frequently become masterminds of their people, hatching complex and nefarious plots to turn the tables against those troublesome “heroes.”</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The NPC’s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drop by 2 each but his Intelligence and Wisdom rise by 4 each. His Competence rises by 3 and he also gains burden of ages, cagey II, class ability (Courtier: master plan I, never outdone; Keeper: bright idea II), and fatal falls.</p><h3>EXAMPLE: ANCIENT GHOUL</h3><p>An ancient ghoul is a corpulent, withered king, bloated by great feasts on the dead and many years of relative comfort. Though somewhat less adept in combat than his “subjects,” this vile creature’s surprisingly sharp mind more than makes up the difference.</p><p><strong>Ancient Ghoul (Medium Undead Walker — 78 XP):</strong> Str 8, Dex 10, Con 8, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 10; SZ M (1×1, Reach 1); Spd 30 ft. ground; Init IV; Atk III; Def III; Res V; HealthVI; Comp IV; Skills: Sneak V; Qualities: Burden of ages, cagey II, class ability (Courtier: master plan I, never outdone; Keeper: bright idea II), fatal falls, feral, improved sense (scent), stench, swarm</p><p><em>Attacks/Weapons: </em>Bite I (dmg 1d8–1 lethal; threat 18–20), Ghoul Fever (sickening attack II: Will DC 15 or become sickened for 2d6 rounds; upgrades: supernatural attack (bite)), Claw I (dmg 1d6–1 lethal; threat 20), Paralyzing Claw (paralyzing attack I: Will DC 10 or become paralyzed 1d6 rounds; upgrades: supernatural attack (claw))</p><p><em>Treasure:</em> 1L, 1G, 1T</p><h3>EXAMPLE: ANCIENT NAGA</h3><p>A self-appointed avatar of Sssyt, god of snakes, this wrinkled, bitter creature’s malicious streak has only grown over the long ages.

Each is a wonder of science — made of steel and iron, moved by pistons and cogs, and powered by magic, steam, coal, or other mysterious technologies. Most clockwork creatures serve as ageless sentinels or testaments to their master’s craft but some escape into the wild, or are released to further the experiment.</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Non-Construct</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The NPC gains the Construct Type, damage reduction 3, and Slam III.</p><h3>EXAMPLE: CLOCKWORK SPRITE</h3><p>These wind-up faerie were created by a lonely artificer, to entertain and carry out small tasks. With their master gone, these little angels have become tiny terrors, attacking all who enter his quiet laboratory…</p><p><strong>Clockwork Sprite (Diminutive Construct Fey Flyer/ Walker — 92 XP):</strong> Str 10, Dex 18, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 14; SZ D (1×1, Reach 1); Spd 40 ft. winged flight, 10 ft. ground; Init VI; Atk I; Def IX; Res IV; Health I; Comp II; Skills: Acrobatics VII, Bluff III, Impress III; Qualities: Chameleon II (forest/jungle), class ability (Burglar: he did it!), damage reduction 3, feat (Agile Flyer), shapeshifter I</p><p><em>Attacks/Weapons: </em>Diminutive short bow + 30 standard arrows (dmg 1d4 lethal; threat 19–20; range 20 ft. × 6; qualities: AP 2, cavalry, poisonous), Slam III (dmg 2d3 lethal; threat 19– 20)</p><p><em>Gear: </em>Fast-acting baffling poison (3 uses)</p><p><em>Treasure:</em> None</p><h3>EXAMPLE: CLOCKWORK WATCHMAN</h3><p>Common in the lairs of arcane tinkers, these lanky iron men move with stiff mechanical precision and speak in tinny artificial voices.

The Rogues Gallery and Bestiary include many popular fantasy favorites but when you want to add an old standby rather than build something new, you can turn to this handy conversion system.</p><p>These rules work with nearly all NPCs and monsters from SRD, 3.0, and 3.5 roleplaying products, generating a balanced Fantasy Craft stat block. As with original NPCs the result can be used at any Threat Level and easily modified on the fly. Necessarily though, the initial process is a bit more complex than an original build, so you should set aside a little time for that.</p><h1>CONVERSION BASICS</h1><p>The following steps walk through the entries in a standard OGL monster description (except Organization, which isn’t part of Fantasy Craft NPC construction). Detailed instructions are provided for each step beginning on the pages listed in parentheses. Keep in mind that your judgment is just as important as any rule. These steps can’t handle every situation and there’s no such thing as a “perfect” conversion, only one that works best at your table. Feel free to tweak and adjust as desired to keep things interesting and fun.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Size and Type (see page 296): Type determines an NPC’s Competence grade and assigns starting qualities.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hit Dice (see page 297): Hit Dice set the NPC’s Health grade and related stats.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Abilities and Natural Attacks (see page 297): Natural attacks convert cleanly to Fantasy Craft counterparts.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Other Attacks and Qualities (see page 300): Here you’ll port over many unique OGL abilities.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Skills (see page 301): OGL skills translate directly in most cases.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Feats (see page 302): OGL feats can translate to Fantasy Craft feats, NPC qualities, or stat grades.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Gear and Treasure (see page 302): OGL treasure rating converts to Fantasy Craft Treasure Rolls.</p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Remaining Entries (see page 302): Here you’ll convert everything else.</p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Final Tweaks (see page 303): In this optional step, you can tweak to taste.</p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> XP Value (see page 303): Total the XP value of the converted stat block and you’re ready to go!</p><h2>CONVERSION THREAT LEVEL</h2><p>OGL characters and monsters are designed as proper threats in only a narrow level range while Fantasy Craft NPCs scale to any level. Fortunately, it’s easy to convert most non-scaling OGL stats into grades. Start by finding the NPC’s Conversion Threat Level, which is equal to the OGL Challenge Rating (maximum 20), or Hit Dice (if there’s no CR). You’ll use this value when converting many stats.</p><p><em>Example: </em>A remorhaz’s Challenge Rating is 7, so its Conversion Threat Level is also 7.</p><h2>STAT LIMITS</h2><p>No stat may exceed the minimum or maximum listed in the standard NPC creation rules. Conversion rules are often provided for surplus but in all other cases excess is ignored.</p><h1>STEP 1: SIZE AND TYPE</h1><p>The NPC’s Size remains unchanged and defines the NPC’s maximum footprint (see page 217). Fantasy Craft characters aren’t always perfectly square, so you may want to adjust the footprint — listed as an OGL creature’s “Space” — to a more logical shape. Footprint also translates directly from feet into squares.</p><p><em>Example: </em>A remorhaz is a Huge creature and stays the same in Fantasy Craft. Its Space is 15 ft. × 15 ft., which the GM translates to a footprint of 3 wide × 4 long (an arbitrary but plausible choice).</p><p>OGL type and subtype(s) set the NPC’s Competence grade and may add one or more qualities, as shown on Table 6.10: Type Conversion (see page 296). When a character has 2 or more OGL types, apply the highest Competence generated by any of them. A character without an OGL type becomes Folk or an Animal, as appropriate. You can apply additional qualities at this point if you like to bring the NPC in line with a “common” non-human species (see page 230), though it isn’t necessary.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz is a “Magical Beast” with an Int score of 5 (–3 bonus). This translates to the Animal or Beast Type in Fantasy Craft. Given the creature’s Intelligence and SRD description, Animal (and Competence —) seems a better fit.</p><h4>Table 6.10: Type Conversion</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">OGL Type/Subtype</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Competence Grade</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Fantasy Craft Type/NPC Qualities/Other Option</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Type</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Aberration</td><td>II</td><td>Horror</td></tr><tr><td>Animal</td><td>—</td><td>Animal</td></tr><tr><td>Construct</td><td>I</td><td>Construct or Elemental</td></tr><tr><td>Dragon</td><td>III</td><td>Beast</td></tr><tr><td>Elemental</td><td>II</td><td>Elemental</td></tr><tr><td>Fey</td><td>III</td><td>Fey</td></tr><tr><td>Giant</td><td>II</td><td>Folk</td></tr><tr><td>Humanoid</td><td>III</td><td>Folk</td></tr><tr><td>Magical Beast</td><td>I</td><td>Animal or Beast</td></tr><tr><td>Monstrous Humanoid</td><td>II</td><td>Folk or Beast</td></tr><tr><td>Ooze</td><td>None or I</td><td>Ooze</td></tr><tr><td>Outsider</td><td>III</td><td>Outsider</td></tr><tr><td>Plant</td><td>None or I</td><td>Plant</td></tr><tr><td>Undead</td><td>None or I</td><td>Undead or Spirit</td></tr><tr><td>Vermin</td><td>None or I</td><td>Animal or Beast</td></tr><tr><th>Subtype</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Air</td><td>—</td><td>Damage immunity (sonic)</td></tr><tr><td>Angel</td><td>—</td><td>Damage defiance (electrical, fire), telepathic</td></tr><tr><td>Aquatic</td><td>—</td><td>Aquatic II</td></tr><tr><td>Archon</td><td>—</td><td>Damage immunity (electrical), fearsome, telepathic</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Chaotic</td><td>—</td><td>Interests (Alignment)</td></tr><tr><td>Cold</td><td>—</td><td>Achilles heel (fire, heat), damage immunity (cold)</td></tr><tr><td>Earth</td><td>—</td><td>Burrow Speed (see Step 8)</td></tr><tr><td>Evil</td><td>—</td><td>Interests (Alignment)</td></tr><tr><td>Extraplanar</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>—</td><td>Achilles heel (cold), damage immunity (fire, heat)</td></tr><tr><td>Goblinoid</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Good</td><td>—</td><td>Interests (Alignment)</td></tr><tr><td>Incorporeal</td><td>—</td><td>Spirit</td></tr><tr><td>Lawful</td><td>—</td><td>Interests (Alignment)</td></tr><tr><td>Native</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Reptilian</td><td>—</td><td>Cold-blooded</td></tr><tr><td>Shapeshifter</td><td>—</td><td>Shapeshifter</td></tr><tr><td>Swarm</td><td>—</td><td>Swarm</td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td>—</td><td>Aquatic II</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>STEP 2: HIT DICE</h1><p>The NPC’s OGL Hit Dice, Challenge Rating, and Size determine its Fantasy Craft Health grade and possibly grant the tough quality, as shown on Table 6.11: Hit Dice Conversion (see above).</p><p><em>Example: </em>A remorhaz has 7d10+35 Hit Dice, a CR of 7, and a Size of Huge. The die type sets the Health grade to IV and the other stats convert to 2 combined grades of Health and tough I. The GM decides to apply 1 grade to each, so the remorhaz winds up with Health V and tough I.</p><h4>Table 6.11: Hit Dice Conversion</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">OGL Hit Dice/Challenge</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Fantasy Craft Health Grade (min.

Unless the NPC is an Animal, reduce odd attribute scores by 1. Ability scores below 10 translate directly.</p><p><em>Example: </em>A remorhaz has the following OGL ability scores: Str 26, Dex 13, Con 21, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 10. These translate to Str 18, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 5, Wis 10, Cha 10 in Fantasy Craft.</p><p>If the NPC has any OGL natural attacks, compare the maximum damage of each, sans Strength modifier, with the same attack’s maximum damage in Fantasy Craft at Grades I, III, and V (again, without Strength). Apply the grade that’s closest without going over. If the maximum OGL damage is 50% or more of the way toward the next Fantasy Craft grade, raise the grade by 1 more (increasing the attack’s threat range by 1).</p><p><em>Example: </em>Without its Strength modifier, the remorhaz has an OGL Bite inflicting 2d8+4 damage (a max. of 20). At the creature’s Size (Huge), the closest Fantasy Craft Bite that doesn’t exceed this is Grade I (dmg 1d12; threat 18–20). The maximum OGL damage is more than 50% of the way toward the maximum Bite II damage, though, so the remorhaz gains Bite II (dmg 1d12; threat range 17–20).</p><p>Apply the NPC’s Strength modifier to the resulting Fantasy Craft damage.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz’s Fantasy Craft Strength modifier is +4, so its Bite damage becomes 1d12+4.</p><p>Finally, apply any natural attack qualities needed to simulate OGL effects</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz’s Bite is linked to its OGL improved grab special attack, which is easily handled in Fantasy Craft with the grab quality. The final natural attack in Fantasy Craft is Bite II (dmg 1d12+4; threat 17–20; upgrades: grab).</p><p>Don’t worry if you miss something. The next step converts the rest of the NPC’s attacks and you can make any necessary changes or additions there.</p><h1>STEP 4: OTHER ATTACKS AND QUALITIES</h1><p>This step is the trickiest, especially when converting complex characters and monsters. OGL “Special Attacks” and “Special Qualities” are flavorful in part because each one is a little different (in name and function), which makes it hard to sync every one of them up with an identical Fantasy Craft parallel. Most options are available but they have different names and may operate a little differently, so it’s extremely helpful for you to be as familiar as possible with the regular NPC construction rules.</p><p>Start by carefully identifying what all the original options do. Include remaining non-weapon attacks as well, as the process of converting them is similar. Focus on effects rather than flavor, as most Fantasy Craft options can easily be “re-skinned” to achieve the same mechanical result through different means (an identical Wisdom drain, for example, might appear as a breath weapon on one monster and a fear aura on another).</p><p>Once you have a firm grasp of the OGL options, consult Table 6.12: Other Attack and Quality Conversions (see page 298). If this doesn’t provide the necessary conversions, flip through Chapters 1–3 to see if an available class ability, feat ability, or spell effect works (in which case you should grant the NPC the class ability, feat, or natural spell qualities). Note that some class abilities aren’t available to NPCs (see page 232), primarily because they interact strangely with the base NPC rules.</p><p>If you still haven’t found a parallel, you may have to improvise. Fortunately, Fantasy Craft has a robust game system simulating a wide variety of effects with skill checks, combat actions, class and feat abilities, events, action die uses, and many other tools. One of them is likely to give you the rule you need and from there it’s just a matter of adapting it to your needs.</p><p>Don’t feel obliged to convert every attack and quality. It’s generally only a good idea to add what you expect to use in each adventure; everything else needlessly complicates the NPC and bloats its XP. Stat blocks can and should vary a bit between adventures anyway, so leaving room for future expansion can only help.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz also has heat, which translates to the grueling combatant and natural defense (heat) qualities. It also has swallow whole, which translates to a Swallow natural attack. The OGL attack inflicts a maximum of 28 points of fire damage when the victim is consumed and an additional 48 points per round. The GM averages this damage to 38 for conversion’s sake and uses Step 3 to produce a Fantasy Craft natural attack: Swallow III (which at Huge Size produces a maximum damage of 32 points). The remorhaz gains Swallow III (dmg 4d8+4 fire; notes: Grapple benefit — Medium and smaller only).</p><h4>Table 6.12: Other Attack and Quality Conversions</h4><table><thead><tr><th

invested in one skill is just as useful as a point invested in another. Analogs are provided on Table 6.13: Skill Conversion (see page 300). Competence provides a bonus for all skills except Spellcasting, so you only need to convert that (if needed) plus 1–3 of its most critical OGL skills. If the NPC has 4 or more OGL skills, convert up to 3 and increase its Competence grade by 1 per 2 skills not converted.</p><p>For each converted skill, the NPC gains the lowest possible Signature Skill grade that includes the OGL skill bonus in the Conversion Threat Level column of Table 6.1 (see page 229). If no Grade includes the bonus, the NPC gains Grade X and the bright quality (grade equal to 1/3 the surplus bonus, rounded down).</p><p>Remember that a Signature Skill grade must exceed the NPC’s Competence. When a converted grade is lower, the NPC probably doesn’t need that Signature Skill.</p><p><em>Example: </em>Per its OGL description, a remorhaz has Listen and Spot at +8 each. Notice and Search cover these skills in Fantasy Craft and at a Conversion Threat Level of 7 the +8 bonus translates to Grade II.</p><h4>Table 6.13: Skill Conversion</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">OGL Skill</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Fantasy Craft Option</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alchemy</td><td>Crafting (Chemistry)</td></tr><tr><td>Animal Empathy</td><td>Survival</td></tr><tr><td>Appraise</td><td>Haggle</td></tr><tr><td>Balance</td><td>Acrobatics</td></tr><tr><td>Bluff</td><td>Bluff</td></tr><tr><td>Climb</td><td>Athletics</td></tr><tr><td>Concentration</td><td>Resolve</td></tr><tr><td>Craft</td><td>Crafting</td></tr><tr><td>Decipher Script</td><td>Investigate</td></tr><tr><td>Diplomacy</td><td>Impress</td></tr><tr><td>Disable Device</td><td>Prestidigitation</td></tr><tr><td>Disguise</td><td>Disguise</td></tr><tr><td>Escape Artist</td><td>Athletics</td></tr><tr><td>Forgery</td><td>Crafting</td></tr><tr><td>Gather Information</td><td>Investigate</td></tr><tr><td>Handle Animal</td><td>Survival</td></tr><tr><td>Heal</td><td>Medicine</td></tr><tr><td>Hide</td><td>Blend or Sneak</td></tr><tr><td>Innuendo</td><td>Bluff</td></tr><tr><td>Intimidate</td><td>Intimidate</td></tr><tr><td>Intuit Direction</td><td>Survival</td></tr><tr><td>Jump</td><td>Acrobatics</td></tr><tr><td>Knowledge</td><td>Interests quality (see page 234)</td></tr><tr><td>Listen</td><td>Notice or Search</td></tr><tr><td>Move Silently</td><td>Sneak</td></tr><tr><td>Open Lock</td><td>Prestidigitation</td></tr><tr><td>Perform</td><td>Impress</td></tr><tr><td>Pick Pocket</td><td>Prestidigitation</td></tr><tr><td>Profession (chosen area)</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Read Lips</td><td>Search or Sense Motive</td></tr><tr><td>Ride</td><td>Ride</td></tr><tr><td>Scry</td><td>Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Search</td><td>Search</td></tr><tr><td>Sense Motive</td><td>Sense Motive</td></tr><tr><td>Sleight of Hand</td><td>Prestidigitation</td></tr><tr><td>Speak Language</td><td>Interests quality (see page 234)</td></tr><tr><td>Spellcraft</td><td>Investigate</td></tr><tr><td>Spot</td><td>Notice</td></tr><tr><td>Survival</td><td>Survival</td></tr><tr><td>Swim</td><td>Athletics</td></tr><tr><td>Tumble</td><td>Acrobatics</td></tr><tr><td>Use Magic Device</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Use Rope</td><td>Athletics</td></tr><tr><td>Wilderness Lore</td><td>Survival</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>STEP 6: FEATS</h1><p>Feats are probably the second most challenging part of conversion, with nearly as much variation as Other Attacks and Qualities. Fortunately, the number of OGL feats that find regular use is fairly narrow. Fantasy Craft features ready parallels for most as shown on Table 6.14: Feat Conversion (see page 301). For those not listed, consult Step 4 and see if you can match the feat’s effect with an NPC quality or other option.</p><p>As in the previous step, focus only on the most vital feats and ignore the rest. More than a few feats can make an NPC difficult to play anyway, requiring lots of memorization or book reference.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The SRD remorhaz has 3 feats: Awesome Blow, Improved Bull Rush, and Power Attack. These translate to knockback, the Athletics Signature Skill, and Feat (All-Out Attack), respectively. The GM assigns both qualities and arbitrarily adds Athletics IV to the NPC’s stat block.</p><h4>Table 6.14: Feat Conversion</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">OGL Feat</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Fantasy Craft Option</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ability Focus</td><td>Extraordinary or natural attack grade</td></tr><tr><td>Alertness</td><td>Notice or Search Signature Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Awesome Blow</td><td>Knockback quality</td></tr><tr><td>Blind-Fight</td><td>Feat (Night Fighting) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Cleave</td><td>Feat (Cleave Basics) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Combat Casting</td><td>Resolve Signature Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Combat Expertise</td><td>Feat (Elusive) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Combat Reflexes</td><td>Feat (Combat Instincts) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Die-Hard</td><td>Ferocity quality</td></tr><tr><td>Dodge</td><td>Defense grade</td></tr><tr><td>Empower Spell</td><td>Feat (Spell Conversion: Effect) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Extra Turning</td><td>Class ability (Priest: rebuke) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Far Shot</td><td>Feat (Bow Mastery) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Flyby Attack</td><td>Feat (Charging Basics) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Great Cleave</td><td>Feat (Cleave Mastery) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Great Fortitude</td><td>Feat (Great Fortitude) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Improved Bull Rush</td><td>Athletics Signature Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Improved Critical</td><td>Monstrous attack and/or treacherous qualities</td></tr><tr><td>Improved Disarm</td><td>Feat (Expert Disarm) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Improved Initiative</td><td>Initiative grade and/or Feat (Lightning Reflexes) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Improved Natural Armor</td><td>Damage reduction quality, damage defiance quality, and/or damage immunity qualities</td></tr><tr><td>Improved Natural Attack</td><td>Extraordinary or natural attack grade</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Will</td><td>Feat (Iron Will) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Leadership</td><td>Feat (Followers) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Lightning Reflexes</td><td>Feat (Lightning Reflexes) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-Attack</td><td>Feat (Darting Weapon) and/or Feat (Two-Hit Combo) qualities</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-Weapon Fighting</td><td>Feat (Two-Weapon Fighting) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Power Attack</td><td>Feat (All-Out Attack) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Quick Draw</td><td>Feat (Quick Draw) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Quicken Spell</td><td>Feat (Spell Conversion: Casting Time) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td>Superior runner quality</td></tr><tr><td>Snatch</td><td>Extraordinary or natural attack with the grab quality</td></tr><tr><td>Spring Attack</td><td>Feat (Charging Basics) quality</td></tr><tr><td>Toughness</td><td>Feat (Combat Vigor) and/or tough qualities</td></tr><tr><td>Track</td><td>Survival Signature Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon Focus</td><td>Attack grade</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>STEP 7: GEAR AND TREASURE</h1><p>Gear translates directly; just flip through Chapter 4 to find the appropriate item(s).</p><p>Treasure is a little less obvious. Where SRD creatures possess multiples of “standard” treasure, Fantasy Craft NPCs have letter-coded Treasure Rolls that can lead to a vast number of potential rewards for their defeat (see page 344). Converting between these isn’t difficult but requires a few choices. Start by consulting Table 6.15: Treasure Conversion (see below), which shows the number of Treasure Rolls the NPC should have. The specific treasure codes (categories) should be assigned based on the NPC’s personality, his background, and his role in the story. To get you started, we offer some common guidelines on Table 6.16: Treasure Roll Suggestions (see page 303).</p><p><em>Example: </em>A remorhaz’s OGL treasure code is “None,” which translates to 0 or 1 Fantasy Craft Treasure Rolls. The GM decides that the specific monster in his game has recently eaten a traveling royal, so he assigns a code of 1C.</p><h4>Table 6.15: Treasure Conversion</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">OGL Treasure</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Fantasy Craft Treasure Rolls</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>None</td><td>None or 1</td></tr><tr><td>1/10th Standard</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1/2 Standard</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Standard</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Double Standard</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Triple Standard</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Quadruple Standard</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table><h4> Table 6.16: Treasure Roll Suggestions</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Type</th><th>Common Treasure Rolls</th><th>Uncommon Treasure Rolls</th><th>Rare Treasure Rolls</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Animal</td><td>(C)oin, (T)rophies</td><td>(A)ny, (G)ear</td><td>(L)oot, (M)agic</td></tr><tr><td>Beast</td><td>(G)ear, (T)rophies</td><td>(C)oin, (L)oot</td><td>(A)ny, (M)agic</td></tr><tr><td>Construct</td><td>(L)oot, (M)agic</td><td>(C)oin, (G)ear</td><td>(A)ny, (T)rophies</td></tr><tr><td>Elemental</td><td>(A)ny, (M)agic</td><td>(C)oin, (G)ear</td><td>(L)oot, (T)rophies</td></tr><tr><td>Fey</td><td>(C)oin, (T)rophies</td><td>(A)ny, (M)agic</td><td>(G)ear, (L)oot</td></tr><tr><td>Folk</td><td>(C)oin, (G)ear</td><td>(L)oot, (M)agic</td><td>(A)ny, (T)rophies</td></tr><tr><td>Horror</td><td>(G)ear, (L)oot</td><td>(C)oin, (M)agic</td><td>(A)ny, (T)rophies</td></tr><tr><td>Ooze</td><td>(A)ny, (G)ear</td><td>(M)agic, (T)rophies</td><td>(C)oin, (L)oot</td></tr><tr><td>Outsider</td><td>(L)oot, (M)agic</td><td>(A)ny, (C)oin</td><td>(G)ear, (T)rophies</td></tr><tr><td>Plant</td><td>(A)ny, (T)rophies</td><td>(C)oin, (G)ear</td><td>(L)oot, (M)agic</td></tr><tr><td>Spirit</td><td>(G)ear, (M)agic</td><td>(A)ny, (C)oin</td><td>(L)oot, (T)rophies</td></tr><tr><td>Undead</td><td>(A)ny, (C)oin</td><td>(G)ear, (M)agic</td><td>(L)oot, (T)rophies</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>STEP 8: REMAINING ENTRIES</h1><p>With the most complicated parts of the conversion done you can run through the remainder of the OGL stats. This section covers them in the order of standard monster presentation. Any entries not listed here are ignored.</p><h2>RACE AND CLASS</h2><p>Fantasy Craft NPCs don’t gain full race and class options but abbreviated species templates are provided on page 248 and some class abilities can be applied with a quality (see page 235). As seen in the other conversion steps, you should use these options sparingly, applying only the ones that are most vital or iconic to making the NPC memorable in your game.</p><h2>INITIATIVE</h2><p>The NPC’s Initiative grade is equal to its OGL initiative bonus + 2. If the result is 0 or lower, the NPC gains Initiative I and critical hesitation. If the result is 11 or higher, he gains Initiative X and critical surge.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz’s initiative bonus is +1, so its Initiative grade becomes III.</p><h2>SPEED/MOBILITY</h2><p>Determine whether the NPC is a Walker, Burrower, Flier, or Swimmer as shown on page 227. Its Speeds remain unchanged, though OGL maneuverability is ignored. Apply the banned action quality if the NPC can’t climb, jump, or swim.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz can burrow and walk so it becomes a Burrower/Walker with its OGL Speeds (20 ft. and 30 ft., respectively).</p><h2>ARMOR CLASS</h2><p>Add 1/2 the OGL natural armor bonus (rounded up) + Armor Class bonuses from sources other than attributes, Size, and gear. The NPC gains the lowest possible Defense grade that includes the result in the Conversion Threat Level column of Table 6.1 (minimum I). If no grade includes the result, he gains Defense X and monstrous defense (grade equal to 1/3 the surplus result, rounded down). If the OGL natural armor bonus is +1 or higher, he also gains damage reduction (1/4 the natural armor bonus, rounded up, maximum 10).</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz’s AC is 20 (–2 size, +1 Dex, +11 natural). Scanning down the TL 7 column, +6 translates to Defense IV. Given the natural armor bonus of +11, our fiery friend also gains damage reduction 3.</p><h2>BASE ATTACK</h2><p>The NPC gains the lowest possible Attack grade that includes his OGL base attack bonus in the Conversion Threat Level column of Table 6.1. If no grade includes the bonus, he gains Attack X and monstrous attack (grade equal to 1/3 the surplus bonus, rounded down).</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz’s base attack bonus is +7, which translates to Attack V.</p><h2>REACH</h2><p>Reach translates from feet into squares (1 square per 5 ft.). If any of the NPC’s OGL attacks have additional reach, add the reach quality to the corresponding Fantasy Craft attacks.</p><p><em>Example: </em>The remorhaz has a Reach of 10 ft., which becomes Reach 2.</p><h2>SAVES</h2><p>The NPC gains the lowest possible Resilience grade that includes his second-highest OGL save bonus in the Conversion Threat Level column of Table 6.1. If no grade includes the bonus, he gains Resilience X and cagey (grade equal to 1/3 the surplus bonus, rounded down).</p><p><em>Example:</em> The remorhaz’s second-highest save is +6, which translates to Resilience VI.</p><h2>ALIGNMENT</h2><p>If the NPC’s Alignment is available in the current campaign, he gains the interests quality.</p><p><em>Example:</em> The remorhaz is “usually neutral.” In the unlikely event this Alignment is available in a Fantasy Craft game, the remorhaz gains interests (Neutral Alignment).</p><h1>STEP 9: FINAL TWEAKS (OPTIONAL)</h1><p>By now you should have a working Fantasy Craft NPC but you might still want to tinker with it a bit. If so, feel free to boost or lower his stats, add qualities, adjust gear, and make other changes as desired.</p><h1>STEP 10: XP VALUE</h1><p>As with a standard build, just sum the XP values from all the Fantasy Craft options you’ve applied and you’re good to go! If you’ve created new qualities for the NPC, simply add 1 to 5 XP for each, based on how useful you think it’ll be in the game.</p><p>Here’s our completed example creature! XP values follow each item with a cost in brackets.</p><p><strong>Remorhaz (Huge Animal Burrower/Walker — 85 XP):</strong> Str 18 [+8], Dex 10, Con 15 [+5], Int 5, Wis 10, Cha 10; SZ H (3×4, Reach 2 [+1]); Spd 20 ft. burrow, 30 ft. ground [+3]; Init III [+3]; Atk V [+5]; Def IV [+4]; Res VI [+6]; Health V [+5]; Comp — [+0]; Skills: Athletics IV [+4], Notice II [+2], Search II [+2]; Qualities: Damage reduction 3 [+9], feat (All-Out Attack) [+2], grueling combatant [+2], knockback [+2], natural defense (heat) [+7], tough I [+5]</p><p><em>Attacks/Weapons:</em> Bite I [+2] (dmg 1d12+4; threat 17–20; upgrades: grab [+2]), Swallow III [+6] (dmg 4d8+4 fire; notes: Grapple benefit — Medium and smaller only)</p><p><em>Treasure:</em> 1C</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"fantasycraft","systemVersion":"0.88","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676925490390,"modifiedTime":1677385096177,"lastModifiedBy":"MbxEaKeEd7aIBbFb"},"_id":"vn0my9BZif6LVVMP","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"MbxEaKeEd7aIBbFb":3}}
